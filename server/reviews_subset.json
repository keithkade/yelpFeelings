Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-14", "type": "review"}

Deciding on Wild Thaiger, I chose to save Thai Hut for another time. \n\nThey offer ample parking behind the restaurant and patio dining if you so choose. Seeing no one out on the patio (yea it was warm out but not that uncomfortable), I entered the restaurant and was greeting and seated quickly, choosing a spot at the bar. \n\nThai iced tea in hand I reviewed the menu. Hummm, ok pretty standard menu, but being a fan of curries I noted my choices were limited. I guess I could have had them sub the beef for chicken in the dishes but I wasn't feeling up for the hassle. \nAfter a process that seemed like forever, I decided to start off with the Tofu Towers Appetizer and settled on the Green Curry with beef. \n\nThe tofu towers were well presented with a cucumber \"chutney\" / salad that was fresh with a vinegarette that still didn't do much for the tofu. [The same cucumber salad vinegarette at Siam Thai is more clean and crisp.] While green curry's are not generally my favorite (I often find them bland and less flavorful than a red), the beef green curry was tasty. The heat was one that built up slowly as you ate but was never overwhelming to the overall dish. The jasmine rice was cooked perfectly. \n\nWhile overall I can't complain, I can say I have had better but it is a worthy option when seeking a quick Thai fix.

I've really only been to two official botanic gardens (mostly CBG) however I'm glad Olbrich was another to add to my list. \n\nIt was absolutely pouring down rain when we arrived, which was actually ok because the doors hadn't opened yet, and it also gave us an opportunity to have the gardens to ourselves once we were let in. We checked in with the ladies at the front desk and they happily pointed us to the garden areas and told us about the park; they also lent us an umbrella which was nice customer service. \nWe had a plan to do a loop and visit the famous Thai garden (awesome) and our idea paid off greatly. With the rain ever-present we had our own rainforest jungle to enjoy to ourselves, which made for a very peaceful experience. We passed back around to the rose garden and detoured around the flooded pathways, so I'm not entirely sure which gardens we passed through.\n\nAfter getting soaked (I'm glad I had my waterproof kayaking shoes in the car) we walked through the indoor garden, which was free because I had my membership card for the CBG, otherwise it would have been $2. Even if I had to pay I would have been satisfied, it was pretty cool. They had a variety of trees, fish, painted pheasants, a waterfall, and other hidden gems I wont spoil. \n\nAlthough we didn't make a purchase, their gift shop area was pretty nice for its size. If we had more time and nicer weather, I wouldn't hesitate to make this garden a destination for a bit.

The description was a little clunky--there were other ingredients in the dish description that I've since forgotten--and I got a kick out of listening to the waitress explain it to other patrons.

After the food arrived it took me two seconds to realize that the tofu was the best I'd ever tasted.  Tender, flavorful, caramelized on the outside.  The sauce was a little saltier than I prefer, but still quite good.  The pita had good texture and a nice, buttery taste.  My husband enjoyed the traditional-type burger he ordered.  Our only disappointment is that we didn't save room for dessert.\n\nOther observations:\n-Going early helped avoid parking lot anxiety--they get Busy here.\n-Our red-haired waitress was friendly, intelligent, and overall awesome.

It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.\n\nI'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.\n\nI opened my green curry and said: \"WHERE'S THE SAUCE\"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....\n\nThe Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhile I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.\n\nOverall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-08", "type": "review"}

That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!\n3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.\n4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!\n5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.\n6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.\n7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be \"checked out\" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.\n8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.\n\nOh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.\nIf Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.\nIt's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.\nPlease, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency.", "business_id": "7Z7IkR_-94AjUuDw0fbI7g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}

Dick & Arnie's Barber Shop (DABS) is always booked solid on Saturdays.\n\nSo, I'm really picky when it comes to haircuts. I like scissor or straight-edge cuts (not trimmer cuts), and I prefer to have a guy cut my hair since (no offense, women!). I've been going to $30-$45 per cut salons in several cities for the last 8 or so years, but when I moved to the Madison area, I was having trouble finding one that seemed like it would satisfy my two requests. Then, I read the Yelp reviews about DABS, especially noticing all the great stuff written about Ka. Since it's only a few quick minutes away from my house, with cuts only costing $16, I figured I'd give it a try, and - WOW! I am a loyal customer.\n\nKa gives fantastic haircuts -- the wife approves EVERY time I come home -- and, especially for the price, this guy just can't be beat. As a person, Ka is considerate and focused (he has a wife and 4 kids in addition to his job at DABS), and it absolutely shows in the haircuts he gives. \n\nLast thing: Lisa, one of the barber/stylists at DABS, decorates the place for almost every holiday throughout the year: St. Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, Christmas, Fourth of July.

Therefore, I end up there for groceries more often than not. \n\nThen came yesterday:\n\nI have been looking an issue of Time magazine.  I have tried a few places with no luck.  So rather than waste gas money, I began calling around.  I live about a mile from the Sentry store and thought I would give it a call on the way home.  The phone was answered and I simply asked: Do you carry Time Magazine?  Her response was: Maybe, yeah I think so.  Before I could ask if it was in stock, she hung up on me.  No good bye.  Nothing.  If she was busy she could have said that.  \n\nSo I go into the store to search for it, assuming it is there.  I do find it in the magazine rack and I check the head of the registers.  I hear a voice and immediately recognize the woman who answered the phone.  She had a peach colored fleece on.  She is an older woman in her 50/60's with graying hair behind the customer service register.  I pass her up because I am completely upset to see her doing nothing.  The fact that she hung up on me and I come to the store and I see her sitting on a chair doing nothing angered me.  \n\nI continued to look for my magazine.  One of the cashiers asks if they can help me with something.  I tell her I am looking for Time Magazine.  Her response: Well, umm, what?  Never heard of it.  \n\nNow, I could care less if they do not carry it, but thus far I have been told you might carry it by a woman who hung up on me and then a cashier who has never heard of a national magazine.  I keep looking.  I ask another cashier who might know.  After all, what if I just overlooked it?  She says she does not know.  And that is it.  \n\nThat is my whole experience trying to find a magazine.  I walked out feeling completely terrible.  I shop at the store because it is near my house.  Last night, I decided to stop shopping there.  I will drive to the belt line and go to Pick and Save or up to Sun Prairie.

Instead, all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names.   Every burger I have ever ordered here has been lesser than any burger at any  greasy spoon or family restaurant.   \nI was hoping they would have some steak fries instead of the usual basic fries.  Nope.   The burgers are just that, basic burgers with a sauce to match the fancy name.   What chef dreamed up these recipes?   I doubt it was a chef.  Probably some person that said, \"good enough, let's go make some money\".\nOur burgers yesterday were about 10 bucks each and just basic burgers that should have cost about 4 bucks.   The meat didn't have any distinctive flavor and was rather skimpy, the sauce was not complimentary to the sandwich and the bun was generally regular too.   At least the bun was fresh.  \nI would only recommend this place to my Republican friends because they have no ability to think for themselves anyway and might actually like the place.\nIf you're looking for paradise you won't find it here.

He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!\n\nWe pay and wait.

First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.\n\nOther than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.\n\nOverall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip.

I've never done the tour or hung out in the Bier Stube, though they're both on my list, but between Memorial Day and Halloween I try to make my way over to Terrace Avenue as often as possible.  It's also become somewhat of a tradition amongst my friends to go to Bockfest in February as well as wait in line for Great Taste tickets in May.  These are good times in their own regard, but the best times I've had here are just the random summer nights spent sitting at a picnic table with friends or watching a band playing on stage.  On weekend nights during the summer the place gets packed, especially if a band is playing.  And while it's pretty easy to find Capital beers on tap or at stores throughout the area, nothing beats fresh from the brewery.  As an added bonus, you can often get the seasonals or other less prominent beers on tap here as opposed to the bottles prevalent elsewhere.  This past summer my go-to was the Wild Rice Lager, as well as the Supper Club lager on the really hot nights.  There's even a few wine choices for the non-beer drinking crowd, including Wollersheim's Prairie Fume.  \n\nI've got a decent history going on with the Bier Garten, as this was one of the places I went on my 21st birthday.  My buddy purchased me one of the half-liter plastic mugs as my birthday present.  I've still got it to this day, and I bring it with every time I go out.  Suffice it to say, however much that mug cost has been more than offset by the reduced cost per ounce offered by the mug.  If you're planning on coming back I definitely recommend making the investment.  It beats the regular 16 oz plastic cups and I'd hazard a guess it's comparable to getting a pitcher, without the necessity of coming to agreement on what beer to order.\n\nThere isn't any food service whatsoever, but it's perfectly fine to bring in your own with you.  My personal go-to is Gino's, but there's plenty of places nearby and I believe you can ask for take-out menus of local restaurants up at the counter.  I've even ordered Falbo's for delivery pizza a couple times - just meet them outside the gate by road.  Capital's also put up a large tent over most of the picnic tables, which helps when the weather is inclement.  Mosquitoes are an issue, especially as the sun goes down, but this is Wisconsin so you've got to expect that.  The place closes down at 9:00 PM in deference to the residential nature of the area, which actually is a blessing in many ways.  On weekends it's a great start to the evening, and I really don't need to be staying out that late on weeknights anymore.", "business_id": "Wn8NhS-L1ck6jbTjX88Kkg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-01", "type": "review"}

Its hard to enquire about a dog when no one or information is available regarding the dog. In addition I believe adoption fees ranging from $175.00 to $350.00 are a bit much especially considering the funding the Dane County Humane Society receives.  Perhaps they should consider arranging discounted fees with vet services they use.  I understand it does cost a great deal of money to home an animal which should be taken into consideration by the adoptee however you shouldnt have to spend hundreds to get a dog.

Smoky Jons is good.  I mean, it's smoked, slow-cooked, sauce-covered, deliciously unctuous dead pig.  By nature, it's delicious and awesome and good for your soul.\n\nBut all barbecue is good.  Good barbecue is great.  Smoky Jons is...Good.\n\nI'm in Madison a few times a week for work and we've driven by this place a hundred times and every time said \"We should stop in here\".  We finally did yesterday.\n\nThe interior is nice, an order counter, a few tables, and a log-cabin'esque interior.  An okay place to eat lunch.  The menu is pretty expansive, with a good selection of sandwiches, platters, combos, sausages, sides, desserts, etc.  Whatever you like, meat-wise, you can find it here.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, I decided on the chopped pork shoulder dinner plate.  I should say my family is from Tennessee and I grew up on chopped pork.  I grew up eating at shady back-country Tennessee BBQ places with dirt floors and plank counters and a weathered old man in the back basting a pig.  Barbecue is in my blood.\n\nSmoky Jons was not up to par.  The meat was delicious, but not smoky at all.  You literally could not taste the pit, or the smoke, or the fire.  The sauce was good too, but soooo sweet.  I guess I grew up on a vinegar sauce and I realize that sauce is an intensely regional thing, but this was not what I enjoyed.\n\nThe sides were excellent.  Coleslaw is great.  Beans are perfect.  Sugar biscuits are delish.\n\nHonestly, this is the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  But I've had better at several places in Milwaukee.  And I've had better at countless places in the south.\n\nI know Smokey Jon's is apparently world-renowned for their BBQ so you should probably try it yourself, and honestly I'll probably go back again.\n\nMy favorite though?

Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest.\n\nDetailed Review:\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \n\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \n\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem.  Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \n\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer.  I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.\n\nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  \n\nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \n\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \"from the bag\" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.\n\nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.  Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that's what we're talkin' about.  The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful.  The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored.  I loved every single bite of it.\n\nI also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well.  Huge props to Dexter's for their fish fry - it's definitely a top-10 offering.\n\nIn the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under $40.  We tipped well and called it a night.  I'd definitely go back to Dexter's - sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us.  Thanks, Dexter's!!\n\nDexter's = WIN\n\nFood = 4.5 stars (excellent fish; curds and fries were stellar)\nService = 2 stars (they forgot about us, but made up for it)\nValue = 2 stars (would've been over $85 for the 4 of us)\nMisc = 3 stars (the place isn't much to look at, but has an excellent beer selection...)\n\nOh - also, parking is hard to come by, so be prepared to park on the street and/or walk a bit to get there.", "business_id": "HTplzElel_F_U_qhWuDKdg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-22", "type": "review"}

Be more refined?  You know, go to high-end fancy shmancy places?  \n\nMy friend, welcome to the place where millionaires shop for groceries.  \n\nOkay, I have no idea if that statement is accurate.  But, how many grocery stores do you go to that play classical music?  \n\nThis place pays a lot of attention to detail and it shows.  The store is very clean, bright, well laid out, and bears a friendly staff that is eager to help.  The produce department is world-class, with fresh clean produce that doesn't disappoint.  \n\nI think what I appreciate the most about this place is the huge deli and prepared foods section.  If you're in need of a ready made meal or something hot and tasty, this is the place to get it.  \n\nOne downside is the selection.  The store and aisles are too small to accommodate a large selection, so don't expect to find 13 different brands of canned diced tomatoes.  But they do have a generic brand for most items.  \n\nThe prices are a bit high, but not unreasonable.  In this case, you're paying more for the shopping experience and the quality of products.  \n\nAlso, parents, they have nice carts with attached cars.  Plus a tiny cart with a flag on it that says \"Customer in training.\"  When you're shopping with a two year old, that is HUGE.\n\nBottom line, I like this place a lot.

All new equipment and works great. \n\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \n\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \n\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\n\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\n\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot. Its about as narrow as one lane, and people come in and out of same drag.", "business_id": "qNBvH111qgJgLYUScbph7g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-24", "type": "review"}

This place is known for its ribs, and it deserves the praise it gets for them. There are some other hits, and some less than stellar items on the menu. \n\nWe got the half slab and jumbo 1/2 chicken dinner to share, which was huge! Big portions, but the chicken was really dry. The ribs were amazing. We also ordered some beef brisket, which is a much smaller portion than the ribs and chicken. If you're not a fan of fatty brisket (like me) than you'll be quite happy with their brisket. No awkward moments of biting into a string of fat and trying to spit it out in front of your date. \n\nThe sides, overall, could be better. But lets be honest, you're not here for the sides. If you don't want to order any sides you'll save about a buck, but it's worth it to venture out and try them. The baked beans were iffy. I heard a lot of good things about them via Yelp, but ours were grey-ish and tasted off. The potato salad is definitely full fat and more mayo based. It's a nice and cool way to offset the kick of BBQ. The french fries are more run-of-the-mill than anything else here. We also tried the fried biscuits after seeing so many people rave about them. Maybe I had too high of expectations? They were good, they tasted a bit like carnival food, but they didn't garner a \"Oh my, I'd eat these every day if I could\" opinion like the ribs did.\n\nThe sauce here is unlike any other BBQ sauce I've ever had. It's a bit chunky and sweeter than usual but has a nice kick at the end. \n\nDefinitely go for the ribs. The brisket is good. Chicken could be better. The sides are hit or miss.

My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.\n\nMy grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.\n\nThey seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.\n\nOverall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.   Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book.

I checked the website last night at 8pm and realized I missed the 7:25pm showing of 12 Years a Slave.  So I decided to go tonight.  \n\nI got there to purchase my tickets when the window person told me there is no such showtime.  I was like, what?  Huh?  No.  \n\nShe told us to head out and the times were on the wall.  Well they sure were, and in an obvious place, the numbers 7:25 were removed. The gap was comical.  \n\nWe were told by the manager that updates can be made and will be reflected on the website 15 minutes after they are made.  This means that the showtimes are simply suggested times, they will not actually be honored and can change at any time to put up a more popular film.  In addition to that, it was my responsibility to check the internet before I left home.  His assumption that I have constant and immediate access to the internet was insulting.  \n\nI was not the only one standing there.  Another patron complimented me on the points I made to Tom, the manager.  They are all valid points and completely unacceptable that an email is sent out each week reflecting these times.  Each theater sends out their showtimes.  In addition, I checked this time yesterday.  \n\nThe box office person did not even realize that a time was cancelled.  Inform your people to address the problem in a productive manner.  Perhaps: I apologize, there was a change to the schedule or I am sorry for the error, can I suggest another movie.\n\nThe movie was to show at 7:25.  Unless you got there 30 minutes early, you only had one other movie option.  Everything else started during the 6 o'clock hour.  It was offensive to be suggested that I see some other movie.  \n\nI am not always in the mood for an action movie or a cartoon.  I find it tragic that an award-winning movie is not being shown during prime hours.  There were so many of us dumb-founded that there were no other options.  Tonight, they lost at least ten patrons (that I could see).\n\nTwo stars is: Meh, I've experience better and I would say that is what Eastgate Cinemas has become.  They do not have enough showtimes for movies which lack blockbuster status.  Then to cancel showtimes with no notice is not a great way to do business.", "business_id": "pACm1yLb9Pwc1mOuvC3UDw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-04", "type": "review"}

She offered us a good deal compared to their normal pricing but we were all a little tight on funds so we were nervous about upgrading. She asked the manager to come over and after chatting with all of us for a few minutes (she was so super sweet and informative about the history of the hotel and an absolute pleasure to speak with) she worked some kind of wonderful magic and brought the room down to a killer deal that was completely mind blowing. All of us were so excited because not only did each of us now have a bed to sleep in, but it was going to save us money so that we had a bit more to spend at the Con. \n\nThe room had a separate living room with a couch bed, desk, chair, and foot stool. The bedroom had 2 full-size beds and a nice desk. The view was of downtown PHX and it had 2 nice-sized closets and 2 bathrooms! This was perfect for 3 girls and 2 guys since we all had to get ready at the same time. \n\nThe hotel is beautiful. The lobby is quaint and well appointed. Obviously being a historical landmark it is older and smaller than the gigantic contemporary resorts that many of us are now used to, but it's so much better in many ways. It was warm and friendly and felt like a loved one's home. Honestly I would stay there again anytime. \n\nThere is talk about it being haunted but I didn't get a scary vibe from the hotel at all. I will say that without knowing anything about the haunting history I did step onto the elevator by myself to go up to my room and all of the sudden I smelled some sort of fruity  perfume smell that was not present when I first got into it and the elevator which was set to go up took me down to the basement even though the B button was not pushed and my room was on the 5th floor. The doors opened revealing the basement and I said \"Hello?\" There was no one around. It kind of creeped me out a little bit later when I found out more about the history of the hotel and it's haunting stories. \n\nI highly recommend the Hotel San Carlos for those of you who appreciate history and don't mind a hotel with character. \n\nOh and the parking isn't awful. It's just a little jot up the street which for those of you who don't mind walking a short ways, is just fine.

My mom had even worked for their corporate office for awhile. I had taken out a loan through them during college to help consolidate the debt I incurred from school, and a few years ago (about half way through my loan) I was laid off when the economy collapsed. I was struggling with my bills and though I had taken out the insurance for job loss, they found a loop hole and didn't credit me with the insurance, even though I had been paying the extra $50 for the insurance for over 2 years. Then I contacted them multiple times trying to reasses my monthly payment, as I couldn't keep up with all of my bills, I spoke with Mary in the finance department and through our conversation she was rude and extremely hostile. She accused me of lying when I told her I had been calling in and trying to find a solution, when I asked her if I still paid my payments but paid less, she said that they would send me to collections for not making the full amount. Then she looked in my account and saw that I had money in there (enough for only 2 months of rent and my bills... will no real income coming in) and said that there was obviously no reason I was having problems and I shouldn't have even called her. I was really frustrated, I was trying to negotiate so I didn't have to file bankruptcy. Then after I could no longer pay, due to my dire financial situation, they took out all the money I had in my account and applied it towards the loan... i.e. my rent, without any phone calls or letters reaching out to me before they were going to take my money. Ultimately, I had to file for bankruptcy, but I would never ever bank with them again.", "business_id": "YypLpwWA75Y9aWPCJwTv8g", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-19", "type": "review"}

If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it's ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. \n\nAfter fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening's band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you're a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I'm told they're famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.\n\nOnto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. \n\nWe ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn't recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. \n\nAll this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They're the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there's probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin'. Also, I don't mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night. I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it's crowded.

Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.\n\nOverall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.  Their selection of Thai beer is always interesting something I think you need to try for you beer connoisseurs out there.  Service is always tops and the kitchen which is open for your viewing is spotless - Enjoy!", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-20", "type": "review"}

You walk into a highly secure well thought out maze that forces you past all of their high profit items or whatever they want you to see on the way to your can of WD-40.

I am  partially disabled and can have a difficult time walking, so when a store forces you to walk through needless extra aisles it becomes very daunting.\nThis store seems \"artificially\" large and there is a TON of wasted space, it appears that they made the store as large as they legally could, and for no other reason than that.\n\nI also resent being distrusted to such a high degree. I fully understand that they must maintain a secure place, but Mernard's makes it super obvious. On the subject of distrust, I think they may distrust their employees even more than the customers. This is blatantly obvious when the cashiers have to get a manager's approval to accept a $20 bill or do any sort of pricing change in correcting one of their all to frequent \"computer goofs\"(funny how these \"innocent\" computer error/ pricing over-rings are ALWAYS in their favor).  They also boast a computer at the customer svc.counter displaying the Menard's website, but it doesn't go \"on-line\".  They offer a price guarantee but have no way to verify or look up a competitor's price due to this seemingly and prevailing level of distrust of everyone.\n\nI will give Monona Menard's props in just ONE area (Monona Menard's has an extra large wood shed and selection) and that is their lumber quality and selection. They have the most extensive assortment of awesome quality lumber I have ever seen in any lumber retailer anywhere.

I'm so glad I did! From the moment I walked in to the stylist, they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color, too! There was a little up-selling me with products which I wasn't use to and I must admit, I did cave but I mean, Aveda, hello? Can we say amazing!\n\nI'm still in love with Aveda and I'm now in love with Perry Monage.", "business_id": "Og03_vbBCVAFNHXgdflRLw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-23", "type": "review"}

I was greeted by a revolving door that looked like the windows hadn't been cleaned since the last time Jimmy Buffet was in town.  We were seated at our booth, but before I could slide on in I asked if they would wipe the liquid off of the seat.  I went to the bathroom and washed my hands (the bathroom is another story) When I came back, the liquid was still on the seat of the booth.  The waitress just sluffed off the fact i was agitated by the lack of customer service.  Seriously.  How hard is it to wipe off the booth.\n\nThe food was decent.  Nothing great, but ok.  Portions are weak however.  You'll probably have to venture across the lot to McDonalds for a Big Mac afterward if you want to be full.  A Big Mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here. \n\nWhat irked me about my trip here was the service.  First was the lack of caring when it came to the booth's cleanliness.  Second, I never got a refill on my soda.  For $2.49, I'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda.  It took our waitress nearly 10 minutes to collect come back with our bill.  It was like they took my debit card and walked to my bank instead of swiping it to collect payment.\n\nThey get two stars because I didn't have to choke down the food.  However I think I'd rather get in my old car, drive to McDonalds, and risk the chance I get explosive diarrhea before climbing into a sailboat and pointing it toward Cheeseburger In Paradise.", "business_id": "1hBOR97oX5Xph3J8Tdob7w", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-19", "type": "review"}

I was a little baffled when the scheduler told me the next available appointment was not until a few weeks, seeing as I clearly stated I need to get my lump on my breast examined. I may only be 22 years old, and it may be rare for a 22 year old to have a malignant lump, but I do have a family history of breast cancer that was conceived early in their 20's. \n\nAs for my appointment, I had it scheduled at 7pm and I wasn't seen by the NP until 7:45. When the NP (nurse practitioner) came in, she checked out my lump and told me we need to get an ultrasound right away to make sure it isn't anything we need to worry about. When I had my pap smear she told me it looks like I have a yeast infection too. \n\nShe also gave me \"tips\" about keeping your vagina healthy such as Douching. First of all, this is HORRIBLE advice. Douching is the worst thing you can do for vaginal flora. This is the main reason why women get vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis. I had to laugh at her but she is a NP, she knows what she is talking about...\n\nThere were two things that really bothered me about my appointment. The scheduler after my appointment told me she would call me the very next day to let me know the time of my ultrasound at Good Sam. I never heard from her the next day. This is very frustrating for me because I had to wait a while to even get in to see someone and now that I have a suspicious lump, I feel like we are just taking our time for something that needs to be a priority! Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. \n\nI really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable. It was just a waiting game; wait for your appointment, when your appointment finally comes wait an hour for the doctor and wait some more to have an ultrasound scheduled. \n\nI will NOT go back here again.\n\n*update--I called to see why they hadn't called me back to schedule my ultrasound and they acted like I was dumb--saying that they gave me the order to schedule it somewhere else. They basically lost my order and are going to research my situation and see what happened. I HAVE A LUMP ON MY BREAST and this is how they treat situations like this.

Everything from tandoori chicken to palak aloo. Every dish was so flavorful and authentic. Having spent two years overseas where I associated with several Indians, I know they would have been suitably impressed. The waiter brought naan to the table and was there when our water glasses emptied. He didn't hover but he was attentive.\n\nMy lunch partner and I got a kick out of the sign that politely let buffet eaters know we were welcome to the food but would be charged for waste. It should go without saying, but I have been to several all-you-can-eat buffets and have witnessed first hand the amount of leftover food that has to be thrown away because people take too much. Personally I think part of the blame should be placed on the cooks/managers for not putting out a better product, but certainly the customer is largely to blame. Hence, a sign that clearly articulates the Maharaja's expectation of its customers is a good thing.

The reason that I am upset is because the manager could see that I had been sitting and waiting for 40 minutes or so. Nobody even bothered to ask me if I was waiting for my appointment.

Upon entering the hotel we noticed that they had won a single diamond star 2010 and my fiance followed up with that by asking what has happened since then.  The lobby of the hotel seemed to be pretty nice and check in was quick and easy.  Our room was on the second floor and upon entering I was surprised at how small it was.  It reminded me of hotels over in Europe and barely had room to move around in.  We weren't planning on spending much time in the room and so I didn't pay much attention to it.  I guess that I should have paid more attention to the name of the hotel though as that could have been a clue.  As we were leaving the room and headed toward the elevator we noticed a vending machine that was probably 90% empty.  Odd but it seemed to fit with the rest of the dingy decor of the place.  After we got back to the place and my fiance climbed onto the bed it immediately sunk down pretty far.  Not a good thing.  In the morning we ended up checking out early and skipping the free breakfast as we were happy to get out of there.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't stay here again in the future.  Yes, this place is cheap but I would rather pay the extra money and stay somewhere else that feels cleaner and has some more room.", "business_id": "bYdniNQEdYolz0onDWj0CA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-08-06", "type": "review"}

The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \n\nToday is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.\n\nI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors.

Parking is a mess, and I fortunately have a Meriter parking pass, so we walked there from the garage. Construction must be making things difficult, because on that fairly straightforward walk, we kept being kicked to the other side of the street by construction signs. This wouldn't be so big a deal, but 3-year-olds have a tendency to slowly drift across the street, rather than walk with a purpose. We were asked to sign in by an unattended book as we entered. I was fairly sure that the 9-year-old (boy) had already taken a class trip to see it, as he seemed nonplussed but well-aware of the various sections. He did take his totally-cowed little sister through the world's tiniest cave simulation, approximately six feet long. We also went into the mineral room with a black light, to show minerals that glow under that condition. While we only saw a few that actually lit up, but were also unclear on the instructions (make sure you read those thoroughly before turning the light off - it doesn't come back on for a while). They were both impressed by that, but wondered why so many didn't work (search me, kids, I went to law school). They weren't terribly intrigued by the shoehorning in of Wisconsin history as relates to the mining trade, but I appreciated it. Much of it was too over the head of the three-year-old, so a good game to play with toddlers is to have them pick out their favorite mineral in each case and attempt to pronounce it for them.\n\nThe kids breezed through the initial fossil section, paying little attention. It can be a bit dry when one is not on an organized trip with a guide to point out the interesting parts which keep them entertained. There was such a group in the next room, which really is the crowning jewel of the tiny museum. This is the room with dinosaur bones and bone molds, showing off several prehistoric skeletons from dinosaurs, woolly mammoths, etc.The guide was helpful and informative that day, and held the rapt attention of kids between the ages of 10 and 14, not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. It's a small museum, but it did have things that appeal to children of widely divergent ages and interests, and there are few museums who succeed at doing that. There's also a neat rock garden outside with a fountain. There is one central map of the garden, with descriptions of the type of rock that resides at each numbered space. The older boy loved scrambling around to find all the rocks, while the little girl enjoyed the fountain - but use caution around it, because those wet rocks are VERY slippery. I'm not sure how much there is left to return to this summer with the kids, but it's an excellent 1.5 hour diversion, and it's free.", "business_id": "Pn4xv1BGBmtpVBmUcIsrpQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-20", "type": "review"}

I hadn't been to Madison in a few years, so we decided to try a place in Madison (I also figured that they would be more likely  to have restaurants that cater to my needs). My boyfriend did some yelping, and shortly we were on our way to Monty's. There is a private lot which is always nice when you're in a busy city. We did not sit outside because it was a little chilly but the patio looked pleasant and relaxing with beautiful flowers. When you go inside the ambience is a funky little 50's diner with amazing looking pies. Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were able to get a table fairly quickly. As I opened up the menu, I almost died but before that I even thought of moving to Madison right away! There are so many vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options that it is the majority of the menu, which is so rare to find at a breakfast diner. We both ordered the sweet potato hash and it was to die for! Just what we needed that day! I wish there was another one in Illinois. My only suggestion is to serve the fruit on a separate plate instead of piling it all on one big plate, that makes the food messy and crowded.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-09", "type": "review"}

Hotel San Carlos had sweet rates, so this was the spot. \n\nBefore coming here I knew nothing about the history of it.. so I wasn't in it for the ghosts, although my wallet went missing, so could it be the spirit of Leone Jensen that was to blame? I will never know. I ended up getting the King Suite, for the same price as a regular room. Blame it on my abilities to get whatever the hell I want is up to you, but the guy at the front desk was more than happy to upgrade. Score.\n\nOnce inside the room, I was taken aback by the beautiful crown molding, Victorian decor, original radiators heating the room, vintage bed canopy and of course, the antiques that were scattered about. It reminded me of one of my old apartments in Boston, plenty of history to give me that sweet sweet feeling of being back in New England. This was what I dug most. I am not sure how big a normal room is, but the King Suite was pretty spacious. A loaded bar, with stools and all, living room area with a pull out couch, tv and footrests,  an armoir for hanging my clothes, which I didn't use obviously..  I snooped through every nook because it was all so old and interesting and mostly because im nosey. The bed was friggin' huge.. assuming they named the room after the bed would not be totally out of the question. \n\nHere come the complaints...\nThe pillows.. my god, they were so hard and gigantic (that's what she said). I ended up having to use a throw pillow from the couch to rest my head comfortably for I am a small human being with a tiny neck. The bathroom entrance has a step up that is about 10\" high which I am surprised I did not stumble over and fall face first into the toilet followed by a broken nose and bleeding knees in the middle of the night. And lastly, had I of slept in 10 minutes more than I did, I would have been awoken by the sound of the maids vacuuming through the paper thin walls.. There is very little privacy in that sense. \n\nOther than that, the staff were so nice, and it was decorated beautifully for the holiday season. I hear the pool is rad, and how can it not be when Marilyn Monroe herself took a dip in it once upon a time? Other celebs have shacked up here as well.. Mae West, Jack Dempsey, John F. Kennedy and one of my faves..  Clark Gable. How cool is that! \n\nCome to think of it.. I did hear the sound of little children talking and laughing as I was leaving that morning, which I blamed on something outside not knowing the story about it being built on the first schoolhouse in Phx and over some sacred wishing well? Maybe I did experience a little paranormal activity, without even knowing it!\n\nI will certainly be back!", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-14", "type": "review"}

Decent service, mediocre food, fairly pricey for average bar food.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nAfter taking a small fish fry break, we resumed our quest to find the best fish fry in southern Wisconsin. With the roads in poor shape thanks to the recent snow, we decided to focus our sights on local offerings, and since Tully's is \"around the corner\" from our friend's house, we decided to give it a try.\n\nWe walked in and seated ourselves; we chose a small table that was located in a section \"in front\" of the bar area and adjacent to the pool tables. The salad bar and another small dining area are located on \"the other side\" of the pool table room... Odd layout for certain.\n\nOur waitress took our drink orders and we browsed the menu, which included your typical bar fare: lots of fried appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on. I'll say this - there are a ton of items on the menu; even the Friday night fish fry offered 7 varieties of fish, 4 of which are all you can eat.\n\nOur drinks arrived and we placed our orders: AYCE baked cod with a baked potato, AYCE beer battered cod with cheesy hash browns, and AYCE lake perch with hash browns.\n\nWe were informed that our meals also included a salad bar trip... Too bad we had already ordered cheese curds. \n\nBut, being the troopers we are, we ventured over to the salad bar and built a few plates. It was ok for a bar's salad, but not great by any means. My tomatoes were mushy and tasted \"off\"; broccoli was dry and obviously came from a bag. Coleslaw earned decent reviews.\n\nCurds and fish arrived at the same time. Curds were breaded and typical \"from the freezer bag\" variety. Nothing special, and not worth the $6.79 price tag.\n\nFish plates each had two pieces; baked cod was drenched in buttery water and loaded with dill flake. Hmm... It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  \n\nBattered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite \"lifeless.\"  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.\n\nBattered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy. I shed a small tear as grease oozed out of the piece I tried.\n\nThe bill arrived... $55 for three with one round of beers. Yikes.\n\nTully's = fail.\n\nService = 4 stars (good, prompt, fun)\nFood = 2 stars (based on fish only)\nValue = 2 stars\nMisc = 2 stars (not real exciting)\n\nI'd come here to drink some Miller Lites and to munch on some bar food during a game, but I'd skip the fish fry.", "business_id": "kOXJrbuB1a1Na6sf_WQnDg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-13", "type": "review"}

While the hotel has a lounge, it's dimly lit and looks like a run down lounge, rather than an upscale destination. \n\nOn St. Patrick's Day, both the lounge and the Irish bar next door throw a big St. Patty's Day party. If you're there for important business, it's not really where you should be staying. If you're there for a sports trip to go to a Suns or Diamondbacks game with a bunch of guys, then it's fine.\n\nThe wireless signal in room 607 was non-existent most of the time, unless you positioned yourself near the window or in a very specific spot on the bed.\n\nThe first night I brought my MacBook Pro down to the lobby to see if I could get a signal. While I could get a signal, there was no where to sit and plug-in, so that option was out. I went over to the brand new Westin Hotel across the street and used the free wi-fi in the lobby lounge. Truth be told, I'd rather have stayed at the Westin, but I was trying to save the company a few dollars. That's a decision I will think twice about in the future.\n\nThe second night, frustrated, I called downstairs to the desk and the woman told me that I should bring my laptop downstairs to see if I could connect, then go back upstairs. What she didn't know is that I've been in the Internet industry for 16-years. When I pleaded to switch rooms, she continued to try and tell me to come downstairs, even though I'd already tried that the night before. When I insisted that she find me another room, she told me the hotel was overbooked. She also started down the road of blaming the customer, saying \"why are you yelling at me?\" I said, I am not yelling at you, I am frustrated because your hotel advertises free wi-fi, now you're telling me I have to come downstairs (which I did the night before) and try to connect, then go back upstairs.\n\nAfter that call, I took my laptop over to the Sheraton, another Starwood Hotel, which is a bit longer of a walk, but it was nice out. I sat in the lobby on their free wi-fi while watching a bit of March Madness on the big screen and enjoying snacks from their convenience shop.\n\nIf you need a wi-fi connection, then stay far far away from this hotel.\n\nNow to the roach. So, I went to take a shower the morning of my departure and found our not so little friend in the bathtub. Gross. I called down and that sent a bell man up to check it out, but it had scurried somewhere by the time he arrived. I took a very quick shower (which took some time to warm, maybe because of the age of the hotel and it's old water system), checked out, and will never go back.\n\nSorry Hotel San Carlos. While you are a charming little old hotel, you're not for me. I can't recommend you.\n\nI will say that the only benefit to this hotel is the barber shop on the ground floor. They were really nice I got a great haircut, but it was $18. And, the hotel is directly on the path of the light rail from the airport, so it's pretty easy to get to. Although the Westin is now right there too, so I'd prefer to stay at the new Westin in the future, given it's proximity to ASU Cronkite School.", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-22", "type": "review"}

If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine.\n\nThis review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  \n\nWhen you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.  \n\nA quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The \"Philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.\n\nThe best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.

There is also a computer to use if you wish and there are several binders and folders with local attractions or restaurants to try out.   \n\nOur room, the \"Madison Lakes\" was outstanding.  Large, and outfitted extremely well. You will not be disappointed.  There is a king sized bed, a gas fireplace, nice sized TV, with good cable channels, or use of a DVD (you can borrow DVD's from the gathering room), free wifi, a small fridge, sink, and two comfortable chairs to melt into.   The bathroom is ginormous, with a large whirlpool tub, a huge walk in shower complete with steam and rainfall shower head, all of it being very nice.   \n\nThe grounds of the Inn is really a small farm, with fruits, veggies & fresh laid eggs that find their way into the ingredients for breakfast.    Around the far there are several trails to use, winding you past the barn, sheep, a lama and various beds for wild flowers, herbs and vegetables.   \n\nAs my wife and I walked the grounds and headed back to the Inn, we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look.  Inside there are a few comfortable chairs, wine cooler,  a DVD player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used.   We sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town.  However, this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing... the woods, birds singing, farm animals grazing about, all made for an extremely, wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from.   So, we concluded our evening by enjoying ourselves in this tranquil environment accompanied with some wine.    Ahhh... a very memorable time which we shall cherish for some time to come.   \n\nAfter a sound sleep and outstanding shower, we headed to breakfast where we dinned with two other couples who clearly were enjoying their stay as well.  The breakfast freshly made by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob, is made up of several courses; fruit, scones, beacon and eggs, all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B.  \n\nThe attention given by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob is perfect.  They have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the Inn & Grounds really well.  They are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing.   They really do have it well balanced!   \n\nObviously, my wife & I will be checking back in here again.  So, if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind, (which is only a short drive from the Capitol Square) or in need of some quite time, then this is the place for you!   \n\nThanks Speckled Hen, for such a relaxing time and creating some wonderful memories!!!", "business_id": "FrT0OQFkUZBtfoW3V1Wpfw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-20", "type": "review"}

There is part of me that wants to go a little lower, but the management on a couple occasions and the general kindness of the concierge lounge attendants made up an extra star. \n\nThis Marriott is about the level of a nicer Courtyard Marriott. The ONLY way our stay was bearable was because we were upgraded to suite. If we had not had the door to separate our bedroom from living space, we would have been unable to rest with all of the noise coming up from the atrium..and we were on the 9th floor. A cocktail reception on a Tuesday night in the vast open space of the lobby was incredibly loud, but no problem due to our suite.   However a gathering of incredibly loud, rude teenagers whose director used a BULLHORN at 9pm at night to address the entire hotel of teenagers was the last straw for us. We had a two week reservation...we left 5 nights in.  \n\nAdditional issues with this property: the concierge lounge is very, very limited. Every other Marriott (including most Courtyards) have coffee and tea in the lounge throughout the day, not to mention during the cocktail/dessert hours. At this one, there is none during the day, and, most frustrating, in the evening you have to ask the concierge to provide you with a cup of coffee or hot water. Not at all convenient for a business traveller who takes calls in the lounge. Plus the coffee is not high quality. The attendants were very kind, but just not a well executed lounge in comparison to other properties.\n\nI also want to thank the management who alerted housekeeping when we were leaving in the morning to service our room for the last couple days we were there. Prior to that, the room was not being serviced until about 2:30pm, which is our daughters naptime, and she was along with us on this trip. It was a little frustrating.  As for the ACTUAL service, it was hit or miss. One day was great, replenished our towels, toiletries, took out the trash. Another time our daughters blankets were thrown into a ball in the corner of the bedroom, zero toiletries replenished, and two of her toys that were drying in the bathroom were thrown away. A call for extra towels went without towels ever materializing one night.  Also, the in-room fridge does not fully work, and our hummus, juices, and other snacks were spoiled. \n\nI get that this is the area's biggest conference center, so maintaining business is not a problem for them. However, for those of us who travel frequently and experience many Marriott properties, this one does not come up to scratch, but again, the friendly demeanor of most employees we encountered did help the spotty service of this hotel.", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-26", "type": "review"}

Of hearing about it, finally, we decided to walk over and pick up some food.\nthen I read some of the yelp reviews and almost changed my mind. The reviews were pretty bad: several reports of poor service and the -the most alarmingly one of all - pointing out how bland and flavorless the food was. also, there were descriptions of it being a cool baby type place with haughty staff and incompetent servers. Did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger?\nI was surprised because all the times I drove past it - before realizing how popular it was - I thought it looked typical of a thai/asian place. The name was silly and cheesy, and the giant purple banner that takes up almost the entire front of the unsuspecting cinderblock rest. has just the eyes of a tiger staring at you from their very purple perch. How can this place possibly be too-cool?\nI checked out their web site (which I was surprised to find they had one as this place looks pretty hole-in-the-wall) so we could order ahead and walk to pick it up. the site was pretty slow and I almost gave up, but I was pretty stoked on the options and the prices. Grilled peanut chicken? Sounds great. Spicy chicken curry, I'll take it. tiger prawn salad, ok. All for about $8?? Sounds pretty reasonable. I went with the curry chicken and the spring roll (all lunch items come with either soup of the day or the roll - unless your taking out, as they won't/can't do soup to go.)\nOff we went and when we walked up I was surprised to find that the ramada-like, large patio with high walls and iron bars took up the entire front of the building. We had to search around for the hidden entrance. Once inside it was busy with a downtown business casual crowd, but a scurrying waitress still held the door and asked if we wanted a table (for the record she was not in skinny jeans, flats and sporting tons of eyeliner and a fauxhawk, as I figured she would be).  We walked up to the bar to collect our food and pay, and the lively atmosphere made me sad we were going back to the office and not eating there. the bar area had a flat screen tv, there was lively if a little over-the-top Asian pop music, and the healthy crowd was a nice change of pace. Alas, we were in and out (they were not even put out by our asking to split up the to go order so we could each pay separately, even though they were obviously busy) in under 10 minutes.\nThe food stayed pretty hot for the 15 minute walk back, and they double bagged each Styrofoam box -thank god, as half my curry sauce came out of the box. It smelled great and the veggies looked good, but I braced myself for disappointment. Perhaps because I was expecting it to be bad, I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. Mine was just enough spicy as is (for me, though and I'm a wuss - so If you're into hot-hot-hot, ask to punch it up a notch or three) and the serving was plenty for the price. The veggie spring roll was great - not even soggy from the trip, how did that happen? I think the curry sauce was a little thin, but it wouldn't keep me from ordering it again - my coworker's ginger chicken sauce looked thin as well, but she said it was still great. The tiger prawn salad had green, fresh lettuce (looked like a spring mix) and came with lots of scrimps that were \"fat and juicy.\" However, they listed that the salad came with crispy wontons, but her box was sans any wontons - really the only foil in the entire experience.\nAll in all I would say it was a score. The three of us agreed that it would make a good HH spot.\nIt's no yupha's, but certainly better than thai basil - and not a chain. Plus they were still busy, busy despite being smack in the middle of the light rail cluster fuch on central - they must be doing something right!", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-02", "type": "review"}

For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.\n\nAt 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.\n\nI need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.

I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. \n\nI sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. \n\nWhen I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.\n\nAbout an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the \"story\". That if I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy that I would have to contact the police. \n\nAbsolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable. I cannot believe any business can successfully run like this. I will go out of my way to never use them again.", "business_id": "yR3U7jOgoD0V0sGovuyt0Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-02-13", "type": "review"}

After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me.\n\nIf you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you.  It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. \n\nI ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  \n\nOn the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:\n* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.\n* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.\n* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.\n\nNow the positives:\n* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.\n* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.\n* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.\n\nSo, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.  What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research.  And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering.", "business_id": "Ryq600aoE3h8_qRQGIed9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-16", "type": "review"}

At first I thought it was just sarcastic \"Soup Nazi\" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.\n\nAlso, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  \n\nThe kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.\n\nIn short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The \"Harmony\".", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-01", "type": "review"}

Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.\n\nSo I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \"sugar-fried\" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.\n\nI strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.\n\nOh well...", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-06-01", "type": "review"}

I think we were expecting a normal ice cream shop kind of atmosphere, with a big case of flavors to look at, so we had a bit of a deer-in-headlights moment when we first walked in, trying to figure out what we were supposed to order. It turns out they only have 3 flavors (vanilla, chocolate, and one other) per day, and most of your choices come from what sort of sundae you get. Once we figured that out, a number of the sundae choices seemed pretty solid. I ended up going with Turtle, and my husband got the Peanut Butter Cup. Both were excellent. The chocolate shell on the PBC was nicely chocolaty, especially for that kind of a product, and I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the pecans for the Turtle. We both had smalls, which were QUITE ample. We also got a K9 custard for our dog, which she appeared to enjoy. \n\nI guess I just have a couple of objections that keep this from being a 4-star place. First, I wish they had more flavors, since I don't always want a sundae (but maybe this is characteristic of frozen custard joints and is not a fair criticism). Second, I think it should be served slightly colder so that it doesn't melt as fast when the hot fudge hits it. Third, I felt that it was a bit overpriced for a fast food-style place. This is especially true of the K9 custard, since we're used to getting something more along the lines of a 79-cent kiddie cone for the dog.

Service, eh.\n\nWe were on the way back from Chicago and decided to eat in Madison.  I found Monty's online so we checked it out.\n\nThe neighborhood couldn't be cuter.  It was noonish on a Sunday, so it was busy.  We waited a short time for our table.  I liked how the person cleaning the table also put the silverware and water down.  It helps turn the tables over quicker and it satisfies those of us waiting.  But don't drink it all right away, you might not get more.\n\nI wanted the egg sandwich, but I also wanted lunch, so I decided on the Roast Chicken, bacon (none for me thanks) and goat cheese sandwich with bean salad.  Dining companion had the Turkey Club with bean salad.\n\nFood arrived pretty quick and my sandwich was excellent!  The bread was toasted perfectly and the chicken was not at all dry and the smear of goat cheese was great.  My dining companion liked his sandwich was well.   The bean salad could double as a chip dip, in fact I have a recipe just like it that I will now be serving as salad.\n\nWhat wasn't great was the service.  The food got dropped off and she never came back.  She was going to bring me more water, but we had with our glasses empty the WHOLE time we were eating.  We never saw her again.  We took out our credit card so if she did swing by she could take it and we could go.

The beer was outrageous, and we were teased a bit when we didn't order it. I ordered the shrimp and papaya. It tasted good, and I know this is Wisconsin, but there were about 7 shrimp on a HUGE bed of cabbage. The plantain appetizer was served AFTER our meal arrived and they were soggy and fairly gross. To be fair, the ribs and chicken was a more substantial meal and was well executed.\nThe worst part of the meal was the waitress. We were not greeted when we walked in although it was the middle of the dinner hour, which wasn't so bad, but it was a harbinger of how the rest of the meal went. After being werved, we didn't see the waitress again. During the meal, she never refilled our water glasses even tho that was the primary drink of my dinner mate.  After we were finished, I had to interrupt the waitress and the dishwasher who were watching TV, very loudly too, in order to get a to-go box. We were then chastised because the box was for my friend, not me, and she thought that he should've been the one to speak up. We shouldn't have had to speak up at all!!!\n\nSo, the final analysis is that they produce mostly good food, but it is WAY overpriced and the customer service sucks.", "business_id": "qodyGnpmj1zEfi7nJ534BA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-06-14", "type": "review"}

OK, I'm game.\n\nFirst, this is the Pinney branch - it doesn't say that in the header.\n\nWhat can I say? Public libraries are awesome and this one is no exception. There are thousands of books, plus magazines, video, audio and even tools (did you know you can check out tools?) all for free. There are plenty of places to sit, tables if you're trying to get work done, and computers for public use. There's also a big meeting room where they hold a nice variety of interesting events. There are several themed book displays around the library, which is nice when I wander in just looking for something, anything, to read. I think my favorite feature, though, is the hold service: you can request any item from any library in roughly half of the state, and it will be delivered to this library in short order. I know, it's a common library service these days, but have you ever stopped to think about how amazingly helpful it really is? And for free!\n\nMy only disappointment is that the circulation desk staff are pretty consistently unfriendly. Rarely rude, never incompetent, just very few smiles and no unnecessary words.

Baskets, bowls, artwork, clothing, dolls, ceremonial outfits, kachinas, and more from many tribes are on display.\n\nWhat is impressive is that most of the pieces on display are donated by private collectors. Senator Barry Goldwater's collection of about 400 kachinas were donated and on display among many others who gave to the museum. There are also free hourly tours by knowledgeable museum staff. There is even a children's area with hands on crafts, exhibits, and learning tools. \n\nThe layout of the museum is very open and thought provoking, the exhibits are displayed well, and the staff helpful.

Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever.

All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  \n\nThe restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.

The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious.

I'd probably rate it at 3.5 stars if I could so that my scores relative to this one would make more sense overall.  But I digress....\n\nI ordered the ribs and a brisket sandwich with the spicy corn and the baked beans for dinner about two weeks ago.\n\nThe verdicts:\n\nRibs = VERY well done.  Tender, pull-off-the-bone and delicious.  The sauce is where you get the refinement too (beyond the smoking process of course, which is an art in itself).  There are a lot of flavors going on in the sauce and it's not overdone in terms of application.  I've eaten BBQ everywhere and this place's ribs stand up with anyone's.\n\nBrisket Sandwich = Boring.  I was told what I was ordering, so kudos to the service because they were dead on.  It was less of a sandwich and more of brisket on a plain roll.  That's fine of course, but for some reason I feel like sandwich doesn't describe this well.  It does remind me of the bare minimum approach you find in many BBQ joints around, but I don't like it there either.  Anyway, the brisket was very tasty and you should just order it on its own.  No point in getting a piece of bread that just hides the taste of good BBQ.\n\nSpicy Corn = Awesome.  Truly delicious stuff, and I plowed through it in 30 seconds.  Perfect amount of spice too.  Wish I had a little more in that serving, but it will bring me back...soooo mission accomplished?\n\nBaked Beans = Awesome.  I asked if they were made in house, I was told that they were and my palate was rewarded with some of the finest baked beans one can find.  Thick, almost pasty (in a good way) and chock full of flavor.\n\nThe only downfalls would be that it's somewhat pricey for what you get, but food is going up everywhere.  I also ordered a sandwich combo, which was a mistake.  \n\nThe service was top notch.  Everything and more was explained to me in detail.  I only have myself to blame for trying that damn sandwich combo.  Please take it off of the menu...your customers are getting punished for ordering it and it takes away from what you do best.\n\nThe decor is nice and very 'southern' in the sense that this is without a doubt a BBQ place.  I liked looking over all of the trophies and reading the articles and seeing the old pictures.  Very cool stuff.\n\nI got mine to go as well, which was quickly brought out to me.

On one hand, I want to say Monty's is an awesome place with great food. On the other hand I want to say Monty's is overrated. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nI love Monty's because of the options. If you are a vegetarian or vegan you aren't confined to the world of salads. There are many delicious and satisfying options. If you don't restrict your diet in any way, there are many great meaty and chalorically rich options for you too. Watching carbs? Get a sandwich in a wrap. Looking for a healthy lean meat option? Choose one of the several good chicken dishes. \n\nI personally steer towards the lean meat or veggie dishes and have never been disappointed. It's really hard to find a restaurant that caters to my needs as well as my boyfriend's nonrestrictive diet needs. This place does it well and at a pretty decent price. \n\nThough, I don't personally think Monty's is overrated, I feel that the point needs to be made. Whatever you order will be fresh and pretty tasty. However, say you order The Meatloaf of the Gods, it may not be what you expect if you are the type of person that is looking for traditional 'the-way-mom-made-it' meatloaf slathered with ketchup. If you are looking for an extensive breakfast menu consisting of traditional American breakfast combos (i.e. - a dish that contains ALL of the following: pancakes, eggs, hash browns, 3 kinds of meat and toast), Denny's or Perkin's may be a better option for you. \n\nThey put their own spin on the more traditional dishes and have created an awesome list of in-house specialties. Whether you eat meat or not you MUST try The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. It's amazing. Like your beef? Definitely try the Blueplate Burger! Don't like beef so much but still want a burger? Try the Blueplate Burger with a locally made walnut burger. \n\nNo matter who you are, Monty's is worth a try.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-10", "type": "review"}

Third meal I have had here that I didn't care for much.  Avoid it.  Ham was so-so as was the smoked sausage.  Not a good breakfast for me.   Coffee wasn't good this time either.

Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast.\n\nCASH OR CHECK ONLY\n\nWorth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch.  \n\nThey were out of the fried chicken \"dinner\" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?). We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. \n\nThe decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.\n\nThe service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50. \n\nIn short, we will never return.  It is expensive for what you get, food is unremarkable, serve is terrible, and it seemed like it could use a food service inspection because it was pretty dirty.", "business_id": "X47o6R2rWiqGqvBtC7VS3Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-08-29", "type": "review"}

Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nI'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.\n\nWe both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.\n\nPlates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.\n\nThe fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.\n\nInside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  \n\nThe fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were \"average.\"  Dinner roll was hard and dry.\n\nTotal lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.  Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered.\n\nMiddleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL\n\nFood = 2.75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)\nService = 3.5 stars (prompt and friendly)\nValue = 4 stars \nMISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)\n\nSummary: Not a win, nor a fail.

The floors were littered with papers, trash and crumbs, the tables and chairs were in disarray and looked like they hadn't been washed or wiped all day.  I've seen junior high school cafeterias right after lunch that were more inviting.  \n\nThe sandwiches we ordered were OK.  One was supposed to come with dressing, so I asked for it on the side.  A large, overfed bozo yelled from the back they can't give it on the side - either take it on the sandwich or do without.\n\nWhen the sandwiches arrived, my dining companion's arrived with a cup of the very same dressing I was told was not available.   When I asked for the one that should have come with my order, Big Bozo yelled it was too late - I already accepted it without.  I showed him the one we were just served, and he yelled back that was all we we're going to get.\n\nHe then walked up front to where we were seated and told us to get the hell out.  He refused to refund our money but changed his mind after we threatened to call the police if he didn't.\n\nMost Dominos owners take their franchises seriously.  Too bad the drug-addled stumble-bum who runs this sewer doesn't.\n\nHome Depot sells toilets for s**t like this, and, as far as I'm concerned, ALL Dominos are long overdue for a final flush.\n\nUPDATE, February 21, 2014:  \n\nOn this date I filed a formal complaint with Domino's Corporate headquarters.  I received a very sincere, heart-felt reply, indicating they would take care of the matter and we would be hearing from someone within three days.   \n\nNothing from Domino's was ever heard from again.\n\nUPDATE, May 25, 2014:\n\nFrom Franchise Owner named \"Customer R\":\n\nJason, we appreciate the review and feedback posted on Yelp regarding your recent experience.\n\nWe are so sorry for the unacceptable product and service you received from our store and can certainly understand your frustration and disappointment.

I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form.

Well, I just got back from eating dinner here, and I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do more than write this review -- that's how good it is. \n\nI'm in town for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, and boy am I glad he did! \n\nLet me start with the ambiance. Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were tempted to order the \"Limit-2\" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.\n\nLet me stop right here.\n\nI knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!\n\nOnce we overcame the confusion of what the \"Super Salad\" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.\n\nFor the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the \"Sam-Mex\" section of the menu. According to the menu, \"Sam-Mex\" was created by their executive chef with \"the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures.\" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.\n\nWords cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.\n\nI'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!\n \nAt the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as \"white chocolate tamales,\" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. \n\nWhile I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little \"cafe\" called, Sam's.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-23", "type": "review"}

I made the appointment and the day before the appointment they contacted me to  tell me that the nail tech that I was scheduled with called in sick.  When I stated that my appointment was for the next day at 11:30 , they indicated that she was going to be out then as well.  Ok, I was fine with this, and they offered to get me in at 2:00 or 3:00.   I indicated that I would have to check my calendar and would call them right back, but she put me in  for 3:00 temporarly.  I called back 10 minutes later to let them know that I could not make 3:00 work due an appointment I had at work and would need to have my pedicure at 2:00.  This was done via voice mail and asked them to call me back to confirm this was still available.  I did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to Tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and I left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.   I did not receive a call, so one would assume that they had me down for 2:00.  I took a late lunch from work, and drove over to their location on Whitney Way which is a good 20 minute drive and when I arrived, was told they had me down for 3:00 and that they were booked and could not get me at 2:00.   At this point I was very frustrated, due to the lack of not responding to my voice mail messages. The receptionist told me she was aware of my calls, but did not have the time to call me back, since they were so busy.    This took an hour of my day, and a gallon of gas to drive there, and  was not offered any  compensation for their lack of not informing me that they were now booked at 2:00, even though I told them I would call right back to confirm either 2:00 or 3:00.      This is the poorest customer service I have ever recieved by far from a salon!!   I wonder how they plan on staying in business, when they treat clients in this matter and have no regard for their time and money, ($3.80 a gallon for gas).  I understand that sometimes it is necessary to adjust an appointment, but the lack of respect for my time is over the top for me.   Also when a salon signs up to offer a Group On deal, I would assume the goal for  doing this is to try and build their business wth new clients.   If they do not have the capablity to handle new clients, then they should not be offering this type of promotion.

Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \"No, I already got this half full bowl.\"\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?

Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-31", "type": "review"}

I can't say for certain when my clan first trucked out to Monona, but it started a trend that has kept up through the years.  In reality Angelos is a perfectly serviceable Italian-style family restaurant that does pizza and pasta amongst other things, but I couldn't tell you about anything other than the white pizza.  Over the last decade plus I can't remember a single time when I didn't order the same thing.  Normally this would be boring and I'd feel disappointed in myself for such unimaginative thinking, but in the case of Angelo's my nostalgia trumps all.  And it isn't exactly like I'm here every week - I don't make it out to Monona all that often, and I'm lucky if I grace Angelo's with my presence two times in one year.  But when I do, I'm in white pizza heaven.  It's not the be-all, end-all when it comes to pizza, but there's something to the combination of sausage, artichoke hearts, olives and alfredo sauce that is simply amazing.  It's close to my favorite singular meal in the Madison area, and when I think about it I'm tempted to slap down five stars for the pizza alone.  \n\nI made my latest trip to Angelo's a week or so back, and it marked the first time I'd been since they went smoke-free.  It's a definite improvement, to be sure.  I was, however, saddened to see that the dining room had been renovated.  It looks perfectly nice, if a bit generic, but before it had real atmosphere.  The walls had been lined with bottles of chianti, the fiaschi (the bottles with straw baskets - I looked that up) decorated by past diners over the years.  It was tradition to order a bottle of chianti and document the occasion with a message or a sketch.  I was told by the waitress that the bottles had deteriorated beyond repair and had to be taken down.  I'd always hoped that one of those bottles had my writing on it.\n\nAs much as I love Angelo's, my last trip was just a bit disappointing in terms of service.  The white pizza was excellent as always, but we were left without drink refills for a bit too long.  Maybe it was because it was at the tail end of the night, but the waitstaff came off a bit brisk and the overall vibe wasn't as enjoyable as before.  But maybe that's just me, maybe it was the newness of the dining room that made the night stick out.  Still, Angelo's without the nostalgia remains a pretty decent place, and the first bite of white pizza reminds me of why I'll always keep coming back.", "business_id": "Hld3cjWyfPpW5hDcgXfNQA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-09-01", "type": "review"}

They have always been friendly and helpful when I have a need for my bike. However, those reviews seem to be from older dates (most of them..), so perhaps there's a management change and please give revolution a chance!!\n\nThe bike shop is a middle-sized shop, so they might not have as much variety of products as other huge bike shops. The nice thing is, they are willing to go out of the way to order something for you, even if you just wanted one piece of something. Also, it is a great place to stop by for last minute maintenance, quick fixes. They usually have a long wait for huge project fix ups, but if you just need a quick check or putting on a saddle, something fast, they will do it on the spot and you won't run into the long wait time.\n\nI trust them to do a good job for my bike. Jacob, who I regularly see in the bike shop, was very detailed in explaining my options when I wanted to add gears to my single speed bike. He even suggested maybe building a custom bike might be something I should consider since my Sanwa is not exactly meant for touring.. A week and a half later (I was out of town), my bike was ready. It fits well, the gears are surprisingly smooth for a no gear gal like me. Everything was great!

I found myself at Abra after a fender-bender left my bumper with a deep, ugly scrape.  This is how it went down. I was sitting in my parked car in a parking ramp at UW-Madison.  I vaguely noticed a car pulling in too close in the space next to me--but I was too busy talking to my BF on the phone to pay much attention.  All of a sudden, my car rocked to the side as the parking-impaired perp hit me, and then gunned his car backward, forcibly dragging it out of the space and doing a lovely number on my bumper.  I whipped around to look just in time to see the guy taking off at full speed. \n\nWell...that got my Irish up.  \n\nI am NOT making this up...there were witnesses.  Being familiar with the parking ramp, I was fairly sure that he wouldn't be able to make a clean get-away.  So I jumped out of my car and chased him down on foot--in high heels.  When I caught up to him, it was a terrified teenage guy (can you imagine the sight of a crazy, high-heeled woman approaching at a dead run in the review mirror???).  In short: I convinced him that he should return to the scene of the crime.  I have a broken toe for my trouble--and a laugh every time I think about it.\n\n'Nuff said.  So anyway.  Abra.  I arrived on-time for my appointment, and watched in growing dismay as one, then two people arrived after me and were immediately helped by one of the technicians.  Then I realized that the harassed soul casting helpless glances in my direction as he dealt with an annoying, disgruntled customer was the technician appointed to deal with my assessment.  Stuff happens.  The actual assessment took only about 10 minutes, and then I was on my merry way.  It just seems like there should be a first-come, first-served type of system in place, but what do I know?", "business_id": "-J-kQpDGIkX_1XHfi0HG2g", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-19", "type": "review"}

When my husband and I first met with Carl, my husband and I mentioned we wanted a pink cake (as close to fuchsia as possible) with white decor. We understood if it wasn't exactly fuchsia but just didn't want a pastel pink cake. Carl explained that he probably couldn't get the pink to be as deep as we'd like. He showed us some not so great looking pastel pink cakes. I asked if he could go any deeper with the color and he was hesitant. I appreciated that he was being up front at our initial tasting and consultation. But, nevertheless, we loved the taste and decided to use Carl. \n\nI stopped back in several months later to talk about decor and finalize what we wanted. At that time I brought in a sample of the pink color we wanted. He again stated that he probably couldn't get as vivid as that color and in general talked me out of what I wanted for decor. Instead, he talked me into a white cake with pink decor. I showed him a picture of an IDEA of what I wanted for decor, but explained instead of hearts and vines (such as what the picture had), I wanted vines, piped flowers and music notes hidden amongst the vines. I didn't have a picture because it didn't exist.\n\nThe day of my wedding came, and when I saw the decor on the cake, I was not impressed. Whoever decorated that cake didn't listen to me at all. It looked exactly like the picture I gave them as \"inspiration\" and not like I described. Also, the pink they used for the decor would have been just fine for a pink cake with white decor like I initially wanted. But that one was my fault and I should have stuck to what I wanted. The reason the white frosting with pink decor did not look good is because my cake topper was slightly off white, which would not have been as noticeable with pink frosting and white decor. It looked so bad that I didn't even print the picture of the cake in color. \n\nTo recap, cake color was not necessarily Carl's fault. I should have stuck to what I wanted. However, the cake decor was just hideous and even though I printed a picture of the cake (in black and white), I don't have it displayed anywhere. Not even in my wedding book. Unfortunately, it has almost been two years since my wedding and this little wedding cake still bothers me a bit, enough to write a review after the fact. I was at a wedding show today and saw Carl's Cakes there and the decor I saw on the cakes looked much better than it did two years ago, and spurred this little review. It makes me wonder if they've hired new cake decorating talent who could have given me what I wanted in my wedding cake. Oh well, at least everyone raved about how good the cake tasted at my wedding.", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-11", "type": "review"}

Have no fears.\n\nAs per usual when I hit a Mexican place I ordered the enchilada's.  The appetizer was the standard free house chips and salsa.  Oh, boy!  The salsa!  I always complain that the salsa in not hot enough (even at Mexican places) but one bite here and there was a temporary spice assault upon my eyes and nose.  Both started to run and I loved every minute.  When your body reacts, you know you're eating good salsa.  My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New York City.\n\nMy food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate.  Everything was delicious and I think they make their own refried beans.  Possibly the best beans I've had at a Mexican place.\n\nThe dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical restaurant.  Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly.  Expect to wait a few minutes at peak times.\n\nSadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable to officially do a Yelp check in but, eh, I cannot hold that against the Comedor.\n\nI'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good sign when eating at a Mexican joint.\n\nI have been waiting to find a Mexican restaurant that I can officially dub as the best I've had.  I am confident I can dub thee, Comedor Guadalajara, as the best I have had.

I'm a sucker for ghost stories, I'll admit it. \n\nWhen the boy and I decided to a day of wandering around Phoenix before making our way out to the Grand Canyon for a wedding, we had a hotel choice to make. There's a number of offerings downtown, and in August, let's face it,  not a whole lot of people are visiting this 107-degree town so the options in our budget range were pretty open. \n\nWhat got us to bypass the fancier, but on sale, hotels with their shiny lobbies, fake-scent-pumping ventilation systems and flat screen TVs? The idea that we might wake up to a bump in the night. \n\nAs the story goes, in 1928,  a woman, desperately in love  (and possibly preggers) with a bell boy from a neighboring hotel, took a flying leap from the roof and became a part of the hotel's history. Supposedly the room in which she stayed, 720, is still alive with her presence, as she plays with the TV and glides in shadows across the room. \n\nWe did a little ghost hunting while we stayed, though  Room 720 wasn't \navailable, we were still able to wander the 7th floor and take pictures of the hallways and stairs.

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \n\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \n\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \n\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \n\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \n\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \n\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \n\nBut I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions.", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-16", "type": "review"}

The fish tastes like freezer to me and always has tons of bones in it.  I would much rather go to the Avenue for lake perch.  Always get a baked potato, and it's hard to ruin that.

Give it a try!\n\n\nDetailed review:\nI've been craving some pancakes for quite some time and have been on a mission to find the perfect stack.  I've recently tried 'cakes from several Madison eateries and while most have been decent, none have knocked my socks off.\n\nSo, I ventured out to Pat O'Malley's, which is located on the very north side of Truax field.  Or, as some might say, \"in the middle of nowhere.\"  Yes, it's a bit of a drive... and yes, it's a bit difficult to find.  But, it's well worth the effort - believe me.\n\nThe Jet Room is located inside of the aviation building, which (for those not familiar) is where people lucky enough to not have to suffer the pains associated with public air transportation go for their arrivals and departures via private aircraft.  \n\nThe building features a nice lobby, a pilot's lounge, a small gift shop, a vending area, a front desk for travelers, and Pat O'Malley's.  It's spotlessly clean, quiet, and completely opposite of what you'd find at any public airport.  There's plenty of parking available in front of the building.\n\nI entered the smallish diner and was promptly greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a small table with an awesome view of the airstrip.  Private planes of all types - from small jets to single engine craft - regularly took off and landed during my visit.  It was fun to watch them arrive, taxi, unload, and all of that stuff.  \n\nPat's serves breakfast all day - or until they close, which is around 2:00pm.  Because I arrived at lunchtime, they shared the specials, which sounded (and looked) excellent, but I was there for the pancakes.  \n\nI promptly ordered a coffee, an order of pancakes, and a side of bacon.  After the waitress left, I took note of the food around me, and all of it looked great.  The burgers appeared to be thick and hand-formed.  Many sandwiches featured marbled rye.  The fries and sides were plentiful and appeared to be fresh and crispy.  \n\nI could easily overhear folks talking during their meals and only heard positive comments about the lunch items.  I'll definitely have to head back to check them out.\n\nAfter a very short wait, my food arrived - the pancakes were thick, but as Mio confirmed, light and fluffy.  Butter was served on the side; I lathered the cakes with some of that creamy dairy, splashed on my home-brought 100% real Vermont Maple (grade B, thankyouverymuch), and took a bite.  \n\nThe two plate-sized cakes quickly absorbed the syrup, which made for a delightfully tasty combination.  The pancakes, while substantial, weren't heavy or overwhelming.  A hint of buttermilk provided just enough \"bite\" to the syrup.  Mmmmm - definitely a good experience.\n\nBut the hidden star was the bacon.  It was perfectly cooked; crispy, but slightly chewy.  Thick, but not too thick.  Perfect balance of everything: salt/smoke, thickness/chewiness, and not at all greasy or fatty.  Win.\n\nThe check came - $8 for my meal of cakes, bacon, and coffee.  Service was excellent - the waitress was quick on the coffee fills, made sure my food was ok, and promptly delivered the check and my change.  A $4 tip seemed totally fair for such an excellent experience (plus it was a slow Monday).\n\nPat O'Malleys = WIN\n\nFood = 4.25 stars\nValue = 4 stars\nService = 4 stars\nMISC = 4.5 stars \n\nI'd probably avoid this place during the weekend rushes - it would likely fill-up quickly.  But the food, service, and environment are all top notch, so any wait is well worth it.  Do yourself (and your tastebuds) a favor and visit the fine folks at Pat O'Malley's Jet Room - you'll be glad you did.", "business_id": "j515klfbCAEF3KPiKvHz9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-25", "type": "review"}

They also have a menu full of the fish and mariscos that anglos tend not to order in typical Gringo-Mex outlets. They also don't drown their entrees under an avalanche of yellow cheddar cheese.\n\nBut as an experience I would say even if it does offer a greater selection of authentic menu items, it's not really that much more satisfying than the other places. \n\nI had the carne asada tacos, which were serviceable if not thrilling. The dish came out warm and didn't have the tell-tale signs of having sat under the salamander for longer than it should. At one time these tacos would have been a revelation to anyone weaned on the Lawry's hard-shell ones. Now, with their soft, grilled dual corn tortilla goodness wrapping them, they resemble any number of other \"street tacos\" that have become more and more popular recently.\n\nThe atmosphere is . . . well. . . \"comedor\" means \"dining room\" in Spanish. That's what it is: A big room full of tables. Mariachis were a nice touch.\n\nWe waited 30 minutes at lunchtime on a Saturday to get a table. Maybe that's why I am less than thrilled.  The place doesn't want for popularity. Aside from the wait, I had no complaints with the service.\n\nSo to the uninitiated, I would go with an open mind, not expecting a life-changing experience. I would also advise people to try the things like the lengua molcajete (a sort of tongue stew served in a lava bowl). The availability of stuff like that is what really sets Comedor apart.\n\nAnd keep in mind that \"authentic\" doesn't always mean \"good\".", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-26", "type": "review"}

The decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar.  There was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived.  Only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from Capital. \nEventually sat at our table & perused the menu.  Found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree... seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food.\nApp #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty.  Seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (I think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce.  Two thumbs way up.\nApp #2: mussels in cream sauce... I had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large.  They were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known.  But the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread.  And the bread they serve is quite good.  Two thumbs up.\nEntree: Crawfish Etouffe... I was excited to try this as I hadn't had etouffe in years.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  If you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale Cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed.  Two thumbs halfway up.  The salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland.\nMidway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere.  For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie... nice-tasting but no great shakes.  It seemed to be thickened with gelatin and I suppose I prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly.  Again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6.50 it should be REALLY good.\nOur server was very nice & professional.  Absolutely no complaints there.\nThe nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70... and that included 5 drinks.\nWe have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps.", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

You don't need to be of any particular background to enjoy this well done production. \n\nKornbluth used Andy Warhol's 10 silk-screen prints of the important Jews of the 20th century as a jumping off point for this show.

Kornbluth explored his own relationships with his family (he was of Jewish decent but raised atheist), Andy Warhol's upbringing (fascinating in itself) and the selection process of the 10 Jews in the exhibit. He also touched on the stories of each person (the Marx brothers were done as one set), also giving insight on their individual impacts on our world. \n\nI wish I could remember some of the brilliant lines, but I can only recall \"Albert Einstein is the patron saint of 'What if?'\". The performance made me want to know more about Brandeis, the first Jew on the Supreme Court. I wanted to know more about all of the featured subjects. \n\nKornbluth is a masterful storyteller.

Buying a gimmicky electric bike could be a bad decision.  Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision. And lastly buying anything over $500 from a place that is located south of downtown, cash only, and offers no warranties/returns... seems to put the nail in the coffin for logical decisions.  But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.\n\nPhoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking \"Made in China\" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.\n\nPhoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.\n\nAs for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said \"He is just really fair.\"  And I have to agree.

Afterwards I was impressed and absolutely full, but I wouldn't give it the BBQ crown.\n\nI think most of the value here comes from its uniqueness.  Smoky Jon's sits in a small little log-cabin-style shack, and when you walk in you are witness to the plethora of awards they have received from their delicious BBQ fixins.  Soon, you'll discover their own personal sauce (which I hope you slather across your food), and a menu that has item descriptions which make you want to grow a second stomach.  Corn bread, beans, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, etc; all the delectable food you'd expect from a place like this.  I personally had ribs and brisket with corn bread, and I ate every last bite with no regrets.\n\nProblem is, I've had some really good Barbecue in my life, and the overall taste of the food, while good, wasn't great in comparison.  Some of the places I've dined at in Kansas City, for instance, were a step up from this.  Even some of the dishes at Famous Daves could rival Smoky Jon's, although the ribs certainly could not.  \n\nThe rest of my party all had mixed responses.  My girlfriend didn't really care for what she ordered (I can't remember what it was, a sandwich of some sort), and several of them didn't like the smallishness of the place or the service.  The lady was OK, but she was behind the counter mostly and didn't do much to make us feel welcome.  When we walked in we were all really excited to be there and try it, and she was just kind of \"meh.\"  Also, the location is probably the least desirable of any restaurant I've been to in Madison, but that's more relative to where you live or how you feel about certain neighborhoods.\n\nOverall, worth a try and probably one of the better BBQs as far as Madison goes.

Some co-workers had been raving about them, and ever the skeptic, I had to verify the claims for myself.\n\nArrived at around noon on a Friday, and copped-a-squat at one of the numerous bar stools.  A very friendly bartender walked over, menu in hand, and asked what I'd like to drink.  I ordered an iced tea, and browsed the menu.\n\nTea arrived within a minute, and I placed my order: cheese curds and a bacon cheeseburger, with pepper jack, cooked medium, please.\n\nThe bartender left with my order, and I passed the time by watching the Big-10 basketball tournament and gazing around at the large and expansive bar area.\n\nThe food arrived, and it looked spectacular.  Let's start with the curds.\n\nFriends, I know curds.  Believe me.  You can read all you want about the \"awwwesome\" and \"amaaaaaazing\" curds from the Old Fashioned - those suck.  Point blank - they suck.  They're greasy, they're usually over-cooked, and they're bland.\n\nWhat \"saves\" the OF's curds is their tiger sauce.  And I don't care who you are, but to borrow from another reviewer, \"Sauce does not a good curd make\" (sorry Doctress, I saw your line in the El Tigre review, and had to borrow it).  \n\nThe Sport Bowl's curds are DEFINITELY homemade.  You can tell simply by looking at them that these offerings begin as simple, unbreaded curds, are battered and rolled in a breading (probably Cornflake or cracker?), and then carefully deep-fried.\n\nAnd the result speaks for itself.  They are EXCELLENT.  So good (see photo).  The bartender confirmed they take 'bare' curds, and give 'em the batter/breading treatment, all to order.  I believe him.  You need to believe me - these are the best curds you'll find outside of Green County.\n\nThe burger was equally excellent, and I'm going to go on record to say the burgers here are without a doubt in the Top 3 for Madison-area burgers.  \n\nKnoche's Market supplies the beef.  It's hand-pattied and grilled to perfection.  I asked for medium and received a true medium burger.  The burger wasn't dry and it wasn't greasy.  It had a delicious smokey, charcoaled flavor that instantly brought back memories of mid-summer grill-nights back home...\n\nThe pepperjack had a nice kick, and the bacon served as pork-icing on the cow cake (I'd have said 'beef cake' but that's a bit over-the-top).\n\nThe bun was light and airy - very fresh tasting and lightly toasted.  \n\nThe burger was so good that I'd have no problem eating it completely plain - burger and bun alone.  That's saying something.\n\nMiddleton SportBowl = WIN\n\nFood = 4.75 stars\nValue = 4.5 stars\nService = 4 stars\nMISC = 3.5 stars (not super inviting environment, but it's a bar/bowling alley)\n\nSummary:\n- Best curds in Madison\n- Top 3 burger in Madison-area\n- Go.", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-09", "type": "review"}

The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  \n\nWe started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. \nFor dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.

I needed to simply pump up a tire on my nephew's bike. I had trouble getting to the air value due to a spoke that was a little to snug to the value. Very simple issue....\n\nI walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed. Another white lady and a white gentleman came in after me. \n\nThe first lady bike was serviced. I was clearly next. The guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me! It was clear that I was next, but he didn't serve me. \n\nI patiently waiting thinking something was strange. He then asked me what I needed. I explained and we walked to the pump. He started to pump the air into the value, stopped 1/2 way through, and went to help the white gentleman.

I stood next to the gentleman. As the worker charged the man's credit card in the front of the store, the customer looked at me and apologized for the man working. He thanked me for my patience and went along. \n\nAgain, we went to the pump and the worker finished pumping up the front tire. I proceeded to ask him if he would squeeze the back tire to see if it needed air too. He refused to do it, telling me that I 'should know how to do it.' He told me that 'this is a simply life skill that I should already know how to do'. Huh? \n\nI said, 'In your professional opinion, would you suggest that I add more air to the tire?'. He replied with a short, crisp, snotty attitude, \"you feel the front tire and it (the back tire) needs air, do it\".

It took a couple years because of the diversity and number of places on that street, but eventually he got to all of them. That sounded like a fun project to undertake, so I thought I'd do the same. Picking which street in Madison was kind of difficult, especially since you can stay driving on the same road and it'll change names like 4 or 5 times. I decided to pick one such road: Monona Dr which turns into Attwood Ave, which turns into Willy Street. There are so many great places on this road, some of which are already favorites, but others that I need to get around to visiting and reviewing. Now the journey begins....\n\nIt was a snowy December Sunday afternoon when I visited this Red Robin. The snow kept a lot of people away, but the place was still about a third filled. I was greeted and seated promptly. I've been to Red Robins before and I like to think of them as an easy place to go when my sister is in town visiting with her kids. Kids seem welcome here (they even can get a balloon) and since it's already a loud place, I don't mind when my niece and nephew act up (to say I'm not a kid person would be a great understatement). The burgers here are good with fun toppings. My go to is the A1 peppercorn burger which may rival Bob's Bad Breath Burger from the Weary Traveler when it comes to giving you bad breath afterwards. The onion bun along with the crispy onions on top definitely leaves you reaching for some gum after dinner. If you are feeling gluttonous, the never ending refills of steak fries can fill you up. When they are fresh and hot, they are pretty tasty, but if you are looking for crispy fries, this isn't the place for you. They had some boozy ice cream shakes on the menu that looked interesting, but I'm not in the mood for shakes in winter. Overall it's a decent place for burgers and fries if you don't mind that it's loud, there's tons of pop culture crap all over the walls, and that it's a chain.

We didn't try breakfast items, but tofu scrambler was available and looked great.  The food was delicious, the desserts were enormous and divine, and we thought the service was fast and friendly.  We were there on a Sunday evening and a Monday lunch, and neither time did we wait for a table.  I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a restaurant for both the carnivores and the herbivores, while satisfying both groups.

I had really, really good sausage gravy at a Motel 6 in Custer, South Dakota (no lie!).  I've had passable sausage gravy and biscuits all over this great land of ours...but what I just ate at the Dairyland Family Restaurant comes nowhere close to being sausage gravy and biscuits.\n\nThe gravy itself was passable as gravy.  Lifeless and sad, but gravy.  The biscuit chunks in the gravy was where things start to go awry.  They were all uniform in size and shape (warning!) and they tasted not like sausage, but more like something that was killed out behind the dumpster last night.  Maybe it was raccoon sausage.  \n\nThe biscuits themselves are where the whole train truly derails.  They actually served that slop over freakin' Pillsbury, out-of-the-can, cook 'em yourself at home biscuits!  That, my friends, is unforgivable.  If I want that crap, I'll stay home and cook it myself.\n\nOn the plus side, the service was good.  The eggs were fine.  And the Pepsi I drank was sweet and perfectly carbonated.  \n\nThe decor of the place looked straight out of 1985 and desperately needs some updating.  \n\nThe price would be reasonable--if they had given me decent food.

I thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since I totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.  \n\nExcept, the place was fully booked for the \"Little Miss Junior Miss\" Pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant HELL for Andy and I as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  Can you say O. M. G.  \n\nNow, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  But this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. This made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor. \n\nI realize this is hardly Marriotts fault that the Junior Misses had descended upon Middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  Nice.  And also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  Nice planning!\n\nMan, that whole experience left a bad taste.

For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma.\n\nWe arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli. A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention.\n\nWhen I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients.\n\nIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business. If they don't want our business, we won't give it to them any more.", "business_id": "eptljN50_4BpIwc2Op_A_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-12-22", "type": "review"}

It is never too sweet or too oily.  The right use of butter also gives a desirable texture as well.

The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful.  5+ stars.\n\nDrinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\n\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  \n\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.

You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\n\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\n\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\n\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\n\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \n\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware?

From the moment I got to the office I was already turned off and regretted coming here, I arrived 15 mins early and filled out all my paperwork and STILL waited for an hour just to be seen! Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be.", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-09", "type": "review"}

We were both happy to see that they had such a great selection of Mexican beers and so hubby was able to get a Bohemia instead of settling for the usual Corona or XX. I was super happy to order a Michelada and as always that put me in the mood for seafood which is perfect since Comedor Guadalajara not only has traditional Mexican entrees but a variety of Mexican style seafood dishes on their menu.\n\nEven though we were served chips and salsa immediately upon being seated, we decided to start with the chorizo bean dip since that sounded pretty tasty. I was expecting it to be served in a small dish like the salsa but instead it came out with a giant portion and a bunch of thicker chips topped with melted cheese. Fortunately my fellow Yelpers helped us out but we still couldn't finish it. I love bean dip in general but this one had a great flavor from the chorizo and I didn't feel like it was too greasy. I would say that the chorizo bean dip is a must-order if you are with a group.\n\nAfter that, we got our entrees. My hubby got the Tampiquena steak which was a skirt steak seasoned and broiled and served with rice and beans. Most people would call that carne asada so I am not sure why they didn't name it that on the menu. I thought Tampiquena was when they chop up the steak and put chili sauce and cheese on it. But I haven't seen that outside of Texas so maybe that's a regional thing, I don't know. Anyway, he loves steak so was happy with the meat but he thought the rest of it was just ok. Growing up on the border we are picky about tortillas and these were not very authentic looking and he said they also were not great tasting but not bad either.\n\nI ordered the Campechana and that also turned out to be a humongous portion (see pic). They serve it in a huge bowl like soup instead of a tall footed glass dish like seafood cocktail (cockteles) are usually served in. However, it wasn't really that much more substance in the bowl, it seemed to be mostly Clamato. I did like the flavoring of the broth but I thought the quality of the seafood could have been better. I also thought it was really weird that they served it with lemons and not limes. That kind of gave it a weird taste but I added some more hot sauce and that fixed it!\n\nEven though its not the best Mexican food I've had we still had a really good time. It's a pretty nice looking restaurant, I am really surprised that some of the other reviewers called it a dive?

I am passionate about this school.\n\nI will admit, I was suspect. I thought the parents who were so ecstic over the education offered at ASA might be a little off.  It couldn't be that good.  Really?  \n\nMy son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.  \n\nWe were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.\n\nAnd, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.  \n\nHe loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.\n\nThen the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.\n\nThe school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.\n\nThis school is really a dream.  It's an educational opportunity I would recommend to any parent.  I think my son would write a similiar recommendation!", "business_id": "Z9GH9bo8SHKx3oOokhHLyw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-19", "type": "review"}

I took my wife and daughter out for a special Christmas tea - or I thought so. It was not very Christmas like, although they were not advertising as such, and the music was Christmas, but rocky. The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian. Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. \nWell, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training. Both of these girls would seem happier in a less than Victorian life. We asked about teas and blends, but had no assistance. They only offered a couple and you had to share the pot! What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! \nWell, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. \nMy daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL! Little dainties of mini eclairs and mini cheesecake squares still frozen with some Rheddi Whip Cream on the side. My six year old loved as she has a dairy intolerance and took an enzyme and she got to splurge. All of this with the griping trainer and the poor helpless trainee for 19 bucks a person. What else could you ask for? A REFUND - which the owner graciously gave us. The place has potential - but needs to work out the kinks, up the presentation, get a better scone recipe, take some time to learn about teas and train their staff, and YES - learn to bake desserts!

They live about 5 or so miles from the actual fest and because drinking and driving is never in style, they'd gone ahead and arranged a day in advance for 2 cabs to come pick our group of 7 up at their place of residence at 8:45pm. \n\nNow, this was my virgin visit to Madison at Halloween time so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, though I can't say I wasn't warned. I knew streets would be closed down and blocked off and this wouldn't be your typical Madison experience, but without seeing the Mad city madness first-hand, it was hard to anticipate just what we were up against when it came to our group versus on-time transportation on this hallowed eve. \n\nUnion Cab did miss the mark as far as sending the two cabs that we'd ordered more than a day in advance to arrive at 8:45pm. The first cab arrived at 9pm to pick up the first half of our group off at the fest, but when the first group arrived at said bar and realized that the second group had still not been picked up, they asked if that cab could go back and get us, ya know, since there was supposed to have been another cab there 30 minutes earlier anyway. But the driver said they were unable to locate the second cab and that it was against the rules to come back and pick up the second group who were still waiting since they were not the assigned cab. Makes very little sense, but at the same time is sort of understandable on such a crazy eve, but the reservation should've counted for something. \n\nWhen we (the second group still at the house) tried calling Union, all we got were busy signals being that it's one of Madison's busiest cab nights of the year. So naturally, we did the only thing we could... crack open another beer and wait and chug and wait and chug and wait. It was just before 10pm when our cab finally arrived. The driver was super fun, quirky and costumed for the holiday and quickly made us forget about how Union had failed to provide us with transportation until over an hour after the previously scheduled and agreed upon time.\n\nAlso worth noting, because it won Union back a lot of stars that would otherwise have been missing given the tardiness, is how immaculate the shiny, gleaming Toyota Prius cab was. It smelled divine, and not overpowering or like it had something to cover up. And -get this- it had cloth seats. CLOTH SEATS. It didn't smell like sh*t. ZERO crumbs. Sans stains. Not even a whiff of urine or vomit. Where the hell was I? Bizarro World, surely. \n\nSo, while I don't know that I'd trust Union as my chariot on a big day where I needed to be somewhere in a timely manner (ala the airport), they were plenty fine for a casual booze-bender and the amenities (no puke stains or pee smells) made the ride a pretty enjoyable one.", "business_id": "5TQQy_x_ArR3_5L5L0fFVQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-28", "type": "review"}

It was the kind of kick where I didn't see it coming.  His foot caught me right in the jewel-box and lifted me a good six inches off the ground.  I felt everything go weak in my body.  I crumpled to the ground clutching my boys and screaming.  I cried like a little baby.  You would have, too.  \n\nWeston ran off--I didn't find out he was the one who did it until days later.  When the playground teacher walked over to find out what was wrong with me, I couldn't even talk to tell her what had happened.  I thew up from the pain.  \n\nWhen I could finally function again, I discovered my book had scattered a few feet out in front of me and landed in a puddle.  It was ruined.  And I had brought that book from home.\n\nFor weeks, nay MONTHS, after that, the other boys in my class thought it was so funny that I got nut-rocked like I did, that they spent most of their free moments trying to find ways to replicate it.  When I walked through the halls, I had to constantly look over my shoulder, lest I find a foot planted in my nards.  When I was at recess, I had to stand with my back to the wall at all times, lest someone attempt to crotch-punt me across the playground again.  \n\nIt was miserable.  I had started out first grade loving school.  After that day, I never once liked school again.\n\nSarku Japan's chicken teriyaki is so good, that when I eat it, for a few blessed seconds, I forget the trauma of that event.", "business_id": "9vgu6o1CwP5NakVkb29z0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-20", "type": "review"}

We ended up with about 70 hot dogs, assorted bratwurst and assorted bratwurst patties which are quite inexpensive.

It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite.", "business_id": "wls7FRMgIn8VlK1ji5Ms5g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-23", "type": "review"}

This was followed by a refund on some of our meal-more on that later.\n\nMy friend is a UW student and after deciding to visit him he took us here to eat. We ordered the brisket, rib and chicken. The brisket was cut, almost chipped with a tangy/sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy/crunchy. I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they're often overloaded with lard/butter. As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn't like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else. \n\nI tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout. My friend placed an order of the 'doughnuts' as he called it but they were sugar fried biscuits. We waited and waited, ordered them to-go and even then they weren't ready.

The parking lot has so many huge dips and holes I sometimes think I am being forced to go spelunking in my car.  \n\nThe old lady greeters at the front door are my favorite part of the experience because they remind me of grandma.  But they would probably mace me if I tried to run up and give them a hug.  \n\nThey have a fabric department, which seems to be a feature that the newer, super walmarts are missing.  Unfortunately, the store is usually running a skeleton crew most of the time, so it's hard to find an employee in that section of the store who knows how to cut some fabric.  \n\nMost of the employees here are like most of the employees at any Walmart, underpaid, and overworked.  So it doesn't bother me too much when they frown at me.  I've been on the other side of the register before, so I know how soul crushing it can be.  Though, they may not be frowning at me because of that reason, they probably just know I'm an incredible dufus.  \n\nHowever, there is one employee there who is usually cashiering, and has this wonderful Russian accent.  She's also very friendly and cheery.  The other day she was telling me about growing her own basil, freezing it in ice cube trays with chicken stock, and then plopping the cubes in rice later on for flavoring.  Tricky, tricky!  \n\nAnyway, I guess I am more impressed by the larger Walmart in Monona that has the shopping cart escalators.  I could stand there all day and launch carts down that thing, it really revs up the dork in me.  \n\nBut in the meantime, if I don't feel like heading over that way I could just stop at this Walmart to get maced by the grannies and listen to cooking recipes from Nina.", "business_id": "tZbKiggbDGeBpGnOYk0Syw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-22", "type": "review"}

As such, I really appreciate the new ordering system because it allows me to bypass the wait time on the phone and to avoid speaking to operators who sometimes have trouble understanding what I am asking for. \n\nWhen the cab arrives at your address, a text is sent to your phone and you are able to communicate with the driver via text (in case of delay/change of plans, etc.).\n\nAlso, since you enter your credit card number into the online ordering system, once you get to your destination and are ready to 'pay' for the ride, all you have to do is sign a piece of paper and write in the amount of tip you want to leave, and everything is set.

Why the 5 stars?

THERE IS NO CHANCE I CAN PAY THAT\" while my head was exploding and my face was melting (at work). I don't know if they want this advertised, but they let me leave my car there for over a month (closer to two months) while I made gradual payments and they did the repairs.

When living in Madison years ago, we used to hit all the great fish fries on the lakes around town. And while spending 10 years in Hayward, we used to live for Fridays at Lost Land Lake Lodge and later The Waterfront. Living in Utah for over 20 years, my opportunities are few and far between. So I was excited to have a free Friday in Madison to try the very best. Reading online reviews, going off my past knowledge and talking to friends, I made the tough call between the Avenue Bar (one of my favorite lunch spots) and the Esquire Club. We chose the Esquire.\n\nI hadn't been in the club in probably 30-35 years. Overall, it was a good experience. But it wasn't close to the level to which I'm accustomed to in Hayward on our three or four trips out there a year. We had a great time and I highly recommend it, but we would make another choice next time.\n\nThe bar at Kavanaugh's Esquire Club is great - a full horseshoe with plenty of seating. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday in Lent. It was packed already, as was every spot in the parking lot. We put our name in and were told it would be 20 minutes for our party of two. We were seated in just ten.\n\nOne of the challenges with the Esquire is it just doesn't have a lot of natural atmosphere. The main room with the bar is fabulous. But the other dining rooms are really plain with not a single thing on the wall. The table settings are nice. And outside, it's a totally blah building. Out the back door to the parking lot was an attractive collection of a few hundred cigarette butts sitting on the sidewalk and snowbank.\n\nThe tables are pre-set with great, fresh rye bread and fabulous cole slaw. And we had quick attention from our waitress. The host gave us menus - actually three stapled, photocopied sheets - pretty tacky (I noticed others did get regular menus). It's a full supper club menu with multiple choices for fish fry. We opted for the $9.95 all-you-can-eat ocean perch. What was notable to me as that the current Web page for Esquire lists the price at $8.95. Not good. Cod was also available at a slightly higher price.\n\nThe bread and slaw kept us entertained and both were world class. A heaping plate of fish and crinkle fries arrived in good time (beating the Coke our grandson ordered 15 minutes earlier). We had to ask for lemons.\n\nThe fish was very good - I love perch. But as good as it was, it simply wasn't at the presentation and taste level of what we traditionally get at The Waterfront in Hayward, for example. It was a simple cornbread-type breading that was good, but somewhat uninteresting - not the flamboyant texture of the beer battered fish we have grown to expect.\n\nNonetheless, we polished off the fish, got a few more fries and a chocolate mousse desert. The bill for two with a few beers and desert was just under $40.\n\nLater that night, we also hit the Beachhouse in McFarland, another popular local spot. My wife had dinner there with a friend. This is an awesome place with a ton of atmosphere and great fish.\n\nEsquire Club Summary (five point scale)\nExterior: 2 - Pretty plain building; cigarette butts not pretty\nInterior atmosphere: 3 - Main bar room is great\nFood: 4 - Good was great, not overally thrilled with fish batter\nService: 3 - Generally good, but shouldn't have to wait for main course to get a Coke\nValue: 5 - $9.95 for an all-you-can-eat fish fry at this level is outstanding", "business_id": "68JsiWNLKs8NDCrBCxIWMA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-06", "type": "review"}

But hey, hard-core mustard fan as I am, I know better \nthan to start the day with all-you-can-sample-mustard, right?\n\nSo the BF and I surfed Yelp to find a decent breakfast stop and Lo, right down the street from our campground was C's, so we figured we'd stop in.\n\nNow, it was Father's Day, which we realized when we walked in, cause the place was packed. \n\nIt's pretty much your standard breakfast food, with some specialty bakery fare. Clean, tasty and fairly reasonably priced. It is not a huge place either, but there was PLENTY of waitstaff to keep things moving. \n\nI had the skillet breakfast, which I was very pleased to find had the option of turkey. (This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .\n\n(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)\n\nWaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.  It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us. \n\nI noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now. To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. \n\nIt being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too.

I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\n\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\n\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \n\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\n\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\n\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \n\nI'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,\n\n\"Oh, you're not finished?\"\n    No.\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\n    ..........\n\nI think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school.

The sad thing is that we \"tried\" to go to Red Lobster first, but were repelled by the large crowd of waiting people.  No, I don't want to stand around like cattle waiting for my pager to buzz so I can be ushered to a cramped seat, fed, branded, and ushered out again stampede style.  The mighty gods of chain restaurants everywhere are wagging their fingers at me right now saying, \"what do you expect lady?\"  I know, I know.  \n\nSo we went to Olive Garden down the street.  No wait there.  Our waitress was very young, I'll refer to her as \"Sparky\".  My dining companion had a sudden need to try some wine, so he asked Sparky what would pair well with the lasagna.  She didn't come across confident as she pointed to the list of wines on the menu that mister dining companion was holding.  She finally chose one and said that it would go well with the \"meaty\" dish.  I'm not sure what either one of us was expecting because after all this is Olive Garden and we have almost zero knowledge of wines.  So de-classA!!  \n\nAfter Sparky left our table, dining companion says that he expects the chosen wine to be the suck because Sparky doesn't look like she's even old enough to drink, let alone have knowledge of the fine wines.  But you know, none of this really matters when you consider the fact that compared to her we are old as dirt, and still don't know shit about wine.\n\nI had the eggplant Parmesan with Alfredo sauce.  It usually comes with marinara, but if I'm going to have a heart attack it had better well be because of something I enjoyed eating, not something I felt like I had to eat in the name of my health!  Hell no!  \n\nDining companion had his red wine something or other, and he was right it sucked.  He described it as tasting like, \"the barrel it came out of\".  \n\nAfter the main course I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.  I made sure to look in a direction where no one could see my face before I crossed my eyes from sheer delight.  I am a pumpkin lovin' nerd by nature, and this cheesecake was gooood.\n\nSo this chain experience wasn't too bad.  The only thing that sucked was no refill on the bread sticks.  If I'm going to go slummin' at the chain restaurants, I expect the constant refills man.  Especially on those items they advertise as \"bottomless\" and/or \"never-ending\".   Finally, Sparky took a long time to bring by the check, and this goes against the code of chain fine dining, wham, bam, thank you mam.

Breakfasts are definitely of the \"this is not healthy for you\" variety, but it's good for a treat (I don't know how my kid made it through his cinnamon-swirl pancakes which were topped with the kind of glaze you put on cinnamon rolls, especially after he added syrup to it...)", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-16", "type": "review"}

The room was OK except that they put me in a second floor room that had windows which started at about 5 feet above the floor and the only view was of air conditioning/heating units and I am a lifetime Platinum.  I am not sure if the desk clerk felt it made little difference or what but this is not a crown jewel by any means.

Located nearby the airport, the well-lit, wooded interior starts with a pathway that leads to the large overhead menu, the ordering counter, and the dining area. Adding to the d\u00e9cor are the statewide accolades all around the walls. On this evening, the casual atmosphere happened to be unexpectedly subdued, quite unlike the other BBQ restaurants I've visited.   \n\nWe shared a Combination Meal ($17.75) that included our choice of 1/3 Slab, Smoked Pork Shoulder Sandwich, and extra serving of smoked pork shoulder, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Baked Beans. The Slab/Pork Ribs were smoky, tender, and the meat easily peeled off the bones. There was an excellent hint of smoke to deepen its flavor, and that was further enhanced by the BBQ sauce to provide a sweet higher note, strong black peppery secondary, and anchored by a noticeable spicy kick that reverberates with good hops. For the price, there wasn't enough meat on the ribs, but the flavors were still sensational. The dinner roll that this dish came with was sweet, soft, and spongy. I loved it.\n\nThe Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent as well. The pork shoulders were tender without one single dry spot--perfectly executed and delicious without the BBQ sauce. The meat was flavorful and deepened by its smoky flavor that coupled perfectly with the well-rounded, full-bodied spicy BBQ sauce. I absolutely loved it except for the buns that turned out flaky with hollow spots and lacking flavor. We finished the meat without getting into the buns very much. This sandwich could have been so much better with a bun of higher quality. \n\nThe BBQ Baked Beans were smooth, sweet, and delicious. The Slaw on the other hand was too wet with a weak texture. Compared to other BBQ joints, their sides could use more varieties such as green beans, collard greens, yam and other possibilities to complement this resounding BBQ. They also have two sauces, and I wished we had the option of trying both at the table.\n\nService was impatient at first, as we were initially tentative and indecisive about our choices. I wished the server could have been much more educational with their strengths and limitations to help us make the right decisions on this very first visit. However, she later became much more warm, accessible, attentive, and helpful towards the middle and end of the meal. Price-wise, their items were pricy with the portions we received. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Beef Briskets and Chicken Dinner.", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-22", "type": "review"}

Yes, please!\n\nFirst, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.\n\nOn to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe name \"take-out\" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.\n\nI'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'.", "business_id": "cpGv6ES2hzPCtCUQgipwXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

We got gyros only, no fries (there aren't a lot of options, that might be it right there). They come with tomatoes and onions - I requested mine without onions. \n\nThey were fine. Not stellar, not terrible. I've had better ones at a lot of places, but considering that I only had to drive ten minutes to get these, they were good enough. \n\nI was told 15 minutes, and when I got there 15 minutes (or so) later they were ready to go but still warm once I got them home and started devouring.", "business_id": "OC8AUJshLVimn_-P_INvJw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-31", "type": "review"}

I went ahead and purchased the Groupon after checking out the business on garagefly.com.   I was very impressed with the service here -- they did a comprehensive inspection and everything checked out fine. They made no attempt to up-sell me on anything, including brakes, which the dealership had coincidentally told me would \"definitely be due\" on the next service visit (my brake pads were on the good side of fine when VAS checked them). Everyone seems very honest, and friendly, and while I don't know about the prices for major repairs, it's good to know that they'll only be charging you when you really need work done (unlike the dealer).

I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.\n\nWild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.\n\nIf you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.  But for my money, I'd rather blow my tastebuds out of the park with a mindful chef who prepares her curries and sauces with finesse and grace.

However, this review is mostly based off of a shopping experience that I undertook there.\n\nI was in the market for a couch and shopped around at a lot of places, wasn't looking for anything too fancy or expensive. Someone gave me a tip that Menards was selling a decent one for $250 so I went in to check it out (this was their East Towne location). After giving it a day of thought I decided to pull the trigger. I called the east side and they said they only had the floor model left (they were priced to sell). I asked if their other two locations had some in stock, and they said the west side did, so I called the west side and had one put on hold so I could buy it that evening.\n\nGet to the west side and they have the loveseat, not the couch. ARGGG, I thought these things were organized by SKU, you messed up on the store computer on that one, East Side. The Monona location still has one left though! It's the floor model, but now it's $200 (after $50 rebate). OK, fine. I go to the Monona location and ask if I can buy it now and pick it up in a few days when I can borrow my dad's trailer and haul it to my apartment. They say \"No\" we don't do prepay anymore. Darn. I ask if I can put it on hold and my dad can alter his schedule so that he can pick it up tomorrow morning (this was a deal on a couch that I didn't want to let get away). The sales associate calls his manager and they make a big exception for me. That I'm happy with, and I commend them for being flexible.\n\nHowever, I go to put it on hold, and they say that I need to pay for it now when I put it on hold. What??? So you first say that Menards doesn't do prepay (pay now, pick up later), but when I put something on hold to buy and pick up later, I have to pay now? What's the difference???\n\nAnyway, I'm happy that I found such a deal, and I'm happy that they were willing to make a small exception to their rules, but Menards you really need to get your stuff together.", "business_id": "SqdO4jenDHNwHeSKmULPrA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-09-22", "type": "review"}

Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice). \n\n*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat.

We opted for 2 plates of the lake perch and 1 plate of the walleye instead (I was dining with a couple of friends).\n\nThe service was excellent; she regularly checked on us, refilled drinks, and kept us in the loop the entire night.  5-stars for service.\n\nThe fish arrived and it was swimming in grease.  Gone was the excellent batter that I had experienced in the past; the perch was rubbery and extreeeeeeemely fishy tasting.  The walleye was equally greasy, over-battered, and also very fishy tasting.\n\nI love fish, and my friends are huge fishermen - they take trips to Canada, the boundary waters, and all sorts of other places to fish.  But even they agreed that the fish didn't taste like it should - one barely finished his smallish plate of perch; the other left at least half of the walleye.  I felt especially terrible when they asked me why I felt the fish was so good here... :-(\n\nThe rest of their food remains superb, especially the IPA hummus.  I'm certain you won't find a better hummus in the area.  I would also recommend the habanero shrimp and any of their burgers - they're excellent.\n\nOur check arrived; we settled-up and left, disappointed by the fish.

We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \"Excuse me, miss?\" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be.

The service took a long time, even though there were only 5 tables with customers and six wait staff.

It had only been approximately 6 weeks. Apparently, this location has been sold.  The old owners still own the location on Odana Rd (same name), but not this one.

The appearance of the room is not pleasant (peeling wallpaper, poor paint, visible water damage in the room). The room appears to have last been updated prior to my birth (1980's). Upon arrival, a housekeeper was notified that the lamp in our room did not work. She replied that she would call downstairs to send someone up. Nobody came.  Four hours later, I found a maintenance worker myself who immediately came to the room and replaced the lamp. There is no fan in the bathroom, but that's not much of an issue because there isn't much steam since the water only gets lukewarm at best. On 4-21-14, at 3:44am I was unpleasantly shocked awake by a very loud alarm somewhere in the hall outside my room. I later found out that it was thought to be due to a dirty smoke detector. That increased my confidence in the overall cleanliness of the facility. On 4-22-14, I was appalled that a housekeeper walked into the room without even knocking. That was very frightening to hear a key card clicking in my door when I didn't have any guests!  There are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning. If you don't get one of those, you'll have to pay ten dollars for a mediocre breakfast bar. \n\nThis part deserves it's own paragraph. The smell of this facility is that of an angry, unbathed gladiator suffering the heat of a Roman sun mixed with the excretions of baby post-sweet potato. You've been warned. The air handling is so terrible, I truly cannot warn you enough. I am not able to hold my breath long enough to tolerate the stench. Particularly worrisome is that the stink is worst in a stairwell. If the dirty smoke detectors ever went of with warning of impending doom, that doom may be more so from the stairwell stink (remember not to play in elevators during a fire!) than the fire. \n\nThe pool is nice!", "business_id": "Hh5lyZtOrS5LKk4YCgj8Kw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-04-23", "type": "review"}

My 30k mile Versa had developed an idling problem.  I took my car in for routine maintenance and asked if they would have a look at the problem.  They performed the routine maintenance I requested and although I was a little bit taken aback by the price for the inspection ($100-$200 based on what they had to do) I have trusted them for quality service on other vehicles.  They did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder 2.  They went out of their way to call my dealership to see if the problem was covered under warranty, which it was.  As it turned out Nissan had to replace my engine.  This mechanic could have chased the problem from sensor to sensor and fuel filter and ignition etc etc but they didn't, they found the correct path for me to save money and get my car running perfect again.  After that Matt who is the friendliest and most helpful person you will EVER meet at a mechanic offered to take my car to the dealership and pick it up for me, free of charge.  He even knocked off most of the inspection charge because they quickly realized they wouldn't be doing the work to repair it.  There are cheaper mechanics out there but the quality of service here not only made my experience much better but ended up saving me potentially thousands of dollars worth of repairs that were ultimately covered under my warranty.\n\nAlthough there is a small premium to get work done here (there are shady mechanics that will do jobs for less) the customer service by itself, let alone the quality of work, honesty and integrity of the staff are well worth the marginal pricing differences.  \n\nKeep up the good work!

There is no low end of purchase to get this offer - I bought a pack of gum for under a dollar and they asked if I wanted a newspaper.  Righteous!\n\nEvery department runs extremely well.  I've never had a problem with rotten or outdated goods while shopping.  The staff are plentiful and friendly. Even at the busiest times, they staff cashiers smartly and the lines are rarely longer than three deep. \n\nDuring the late afternoon and early evening, you are bound to run into a vendor providing samples of their local product.  Unlike every other store I went to, it's often an owner or manager that handles the stand.  Frequently they even have WINE!  Delicious wine at that. \n\nLocal foods and brands are center stage here.  They are clearly identified as local on their display.  You'll see local everywhere from the bakery, frozen foods and cheeses (of course).\n\nThe only critique is that the deli prepared foods and the bakery are good, but not great.  If I have a little more disposable income, I go down the road to Whole Foods to get my prepared deli/bakery fix.  With that written, I am very picky and their deli is much superior to Copps (read my review of the very sad S. Park Copps -- I really deserve Metcalfe's!) or other like grocers. \n\nAlthough Whole Foods has a short list of better prepared products (for example, their deli and bakery), they cost so much more (it's referred to as \"Whole Paycheck\" for a reason) and have nowhere near the variety and local selection Metcalfe's has.\n\n\nTips:  \n\n1 - Be careful in the parking lot.  Their are many patrons that have lost their driving skill (think that South Park episode) and it may be frightening at times.  Drive very defensively and always given certain drivers the right of way.\n\n2 - Like their Facebook page for insight on demos and events.  For example, last month they had a three-day cheese tasting event hosted by cheesemakers in town for the American Cheese Society Conference. \n\n3 - If you must use plastic bags, Metcalfe's has the best in the business - they are an awesome green (some sort of implied \"gentle\" dig, I know ... but whatever) and very sturdy.  I use those for my small wastepaper baskets - they look and hold up better than anything I paid Hefty for...", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-09", "type": "review"}

I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere.\n\nTheir menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. \n\nFor the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. \n\nHowever, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. \n\nI pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite.

I went there with a friend and business partner I have known for years.\n\nThe non-alcoholic \"tropical\" drink selection had a variety of maybe 10 drinks and they all sounded good.  I had an \"Island Paradise\" - Pineapple and coconut complemented with pomegranate grenadine and a splash of Sprite.  It was very good.\n\nWe ordered a quesadilla appetizer and it was pretty tasty.  There was plenty of chicken, cheese, and vegetables between the tortillas and the portion was just right for us.\n\nWe decided that we would both order something different so that we could share and try other foods on the menu.\n\nI ordered the \"El Cubano\" a traditional Cuban sandwich, made with ham, cheese, roasted pork, pickle and mustard all pressed inside two slices of Cuban bread.  It was average at best.  My friend ordered the BBQ Cheddar Burger and it was excellent.  The burger is just as it sounds, consisting of a bun, beef patty, BBQ sauce cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, with fried onions.  He gave me half and it was a lot better than the sandwich I ordered.  I did not even finish my half of the Cuban.  My sandwich did come with sweet potato chips which were pretty good.  I am not usually a fan of sweet potato but found myself munching on these chips.\n\nI don't know much about Jimmy Buffett, but the name of this place is actually the title of one of his songs.  There are 38 locations in 17 states, all in places very far from Hawaii.  Maybe it isn't supposed to be like Hawaii, but I feel like it looks like what Hawaii might be envisioned by someone who has never been.  There was no version of the burger made with pineapple slices and teriyaki sauce...but maybe that's because Buffett supposedly wrote \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" in the Carribbean...which changes everything.  Maybe that's why they serve the Cubano, which was still subpar at best.\n\nOverall, the food was satisfactory.  If I am ever in town again or happen to pass by a Cheeseburger in Paradise, I might go back because the drinks are good and the burgers are yummy.  It is a decent meal that won't break your wallet, but take a hint by the restaurant's name and order a cheeseburger.  WWJBD...what would Jimmy Buffett do?  Probably order a Cheeserburger in Paradise, and so should you.", "business_id": "1hBOR97oX5Xph3J8Tdob7w", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-12", "type": "review"}

A group of my friends caught a comedian at the Barrymore Theatre and had some time to kill beforehand.

We setled for Mr. Roberts Bar and Grill, and what a hoot it was!!\n\nFirst off, their food was okay. Nothing to rave or complain about. The menu is limited though - it definitely isn't really a place to go to eat. They didn't have any drink specials, which made me sad :( I'm used to just getting whatever beer is on sale, because I like everything, but no such luck. However, they aren't expensive so I paid about 4 dollars for a beer I think.\n\nThe best part of this place is that it is totally divey, and it had a lot of interesting characters. This drunk 30 year old guy played pool with my friend and had a lengthy conversation with me about how he used to unpack semi trucks or something.. I don't know. \n\nMy friends would say the best part about this place is their mixed drinks (a gin and tonic and a rum and coke I think?) came in pint sizes - haha. Biggest mixed drinks they'd ever seen. Can't vouch for how strong they were - but large none the less.\n\nI wouldn't say this place is a destination, at all, but next time you're at the Barrymore, it is a cool place to check out next door for a drink.", "business_id": "-4PHmmCt_RmAfaE3sDKW_g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-05", "type": "review"}

We've eaten here about 7 times now, and we are ALWAYS delighted. The Beef Panang is just killer. The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love.\n\nPersonally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.\n\nAppetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees. \n\nAnother note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic Thai cuisine.

I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe.

I had a bad feeling and should have listened to my instinct. Wasted $40.\n\nLet me start by saying the host/hostess were the nicest staff at the place. \n\nMy husband ordered the 7 oz sirloin with riblets, seasonal vegatables and mashed potatoes. The sirloin was mostly fat and rubbery. There was no meat to be eaten. It was just a hunk of fat. The riblets even had a weird smoke flavor that he compared to cigarette smoke. We do not go places looking for an all smiles server, but this guy did not smile and when he saw we were not enjoying our meal and my husband's plate was still full, he did not even ask if the food was okay or if there was something he could do. We don't like to complain and just were not in the mood to even let him or the manager know. I really did not expect the food to be so bad. I will stick to TGIFridays, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse from now on;they never disappoint and we have no problem putting down $50 or $60 plus a $10+ tip. For the same $40 spent, we could have gotten a meal we actually enjoyed. The only good part was my daughter's chicken fingers, fries and pepsi. Sad. We will not be returning.

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\"PD\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\n\nI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.

This location is not an overwhelmingly huge store like some of the big chain pet stores I've been to, and yet they manage to cram more variety of foods, toys, and supplies than any other store I've been to. I'm trying to switch my cats to a grain-free diet, and while the cats are resisting, Mounds has offered me lots of options! So wonderful.\n\nI'm not actually familiar with Mounds as a company, but from the tiny bit of research I've done--and the newsletter they gave me--it looks like they are really working to make a difference in the Madison/Southern Wisconsin area. And for that, they at least deserve thumbs up. \n\nThat said, this location is a bit hard to navigate. I had to wander through the dog food to find the cat food, and the toys were in a totally random spot. Once I found them, though, I was fine. I think the store could use a bit more lighting or something to make it feel a little less dungeon-like, but it's not like you're running around in the dark or anything, either.\n\nAs for service, I'm really split. This is where the half-star comes in. While the cashiers have always been friendly while I check out, and the first time I was there I had someone ask if I needed help finding anything (which was the time I didn't, as I was legitimately just wandering around), I've not had any additional offers of help, and the employees I see around the store seem a bit stand-offish. That said, it could just be I was there on a few bad days, as the cashiers were super friendly, so it's not horrible customer service, either.", "business_id": "CLvpX-lYjnz6FvtmMRkYew", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-29", "type": "review"}

True, Dick isn't around much - but in his defense, he's probably been cutting hair for 50+ years, so he deserves some time away.\n\nThat said, I've gone back twice since my last review (my hair grows fast), and every cut has been absolutely stellar.  Ka, who has cut my hair the last two times, is absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive, very helpful, extremely friendly, and really knows how to cut hair.  \n\nThe place seems to thrive on walk-ins, so don't bother making an appointment.  I think that trying to schedule an appointment is the only downside to Dick & Arnie's... and, it was my only source of frustration.  As soon as I accepted the fact that it's best to just walk-in, life has been great.\n\nSet aside 30-40 minutes and walk-in.  Your haircut will take 15-20 minutes, tops; the extra time is \"cushion\" just in case the place is full.  Don't worry about who does your hair - everyone there seems to know exactly what they're doing, and they do it well.\n\n$15 for a stellar haircut?  No brainer.

Selection is limited, however its very convenient. I didn't have much of an opportunity to checkout the outside courtyard due to the snow and extreme cold however it looked like it would provide a great area to relax after a busy day.\n\nOverall all the interior hotel property was clean, with a nice comfortable room. The room itself offered me enough room to spread out. Complete with a workspace, sofa, 32\" flat screen tv and a mini fridge. The bathroom was average size, however not too small where you would feel cramped. The staff here was great, from check in to check out and even dining at the bistro everyone went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. \n\nI already have to return to Madison in a few weeks and have already booked by return trip at this very same hotel.

Here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111026625881803880071/posts/PKBhrxTNQs7 \n\nScenario: \n- I found a special on Angieslist for $139 for a technician to come to my house for a spring AC Tune Up. \n- My system is 23 years old, and the furnace has been very well maintained works fine. \n- The technician was at my house for 45 minutes. \n\n1. Replaced my furnace filter. \n2. Put \"Comfort Services\" stickers all over my furnace (and removed the competitors) \n3. I showed him how to turn on my thermostat (I have a nest) \n4. Hooked up the gauges to the AC and ran the system 6. Stated that I have a very small amount of freon, and that it is cost prohibitive to find a leak ($435-$600, and recharge $161). \n5. Recommended that I buy a new AC unit and furnace \n6. Charged me $139. \n7. Scheduled a Salesman to come to my house 2 business days later to sell me a new A/C & Furnace system for between $7,679 - $8,742. \n\n\nSince then, I have had 2 other HVAC companies visit me and make other recommendations and provide a complimentary \"leak check\" by loading in nitrogen and offering me some other options. \n\n\nConclusion: I've decided to recharge the freon in my system through another HVAC company and they will come out in 2 months (free of charge) to test my pressure again. My honest opinion is that All Comfort Services uses their technicians to generate leads to replace full HVAC systems.

Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were \"going to need a high chair for that?\" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.\n\nWe were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.\n\nShe knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.\n\nIn this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.\n\nAnother server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.\n\nWe go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.\n\nAt no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.\n\nI'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.\n\nI guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-29", "type": "review"}

The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... \n\nFirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \n\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \n\nTo give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. \n\nOver all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget!

I wouldn't go there for my weekly shopping, as it is a bit spendy, but once I have my staples, I will go there for different ingredients I can't get elsewhere, sustainable fish, great baked goods, stellar produce, high quality meats. If I want something special, they're one of the first places I go to.\n\nTheir policy of highlighting local goods is fantastic. There are little yellow signs in every aisle to point out products made within 150 miles or so, each sign showing where the product was made and how far way it is.  When given a choice between a few products, if I know something supports my community, I will favor it.\n\nIt's a very relaxing atmosphere to shop, too. I normally hate food shopping, but it is a pleasant experience, and I feel better when I am in there.\n\nThat all goes away, though, in the parking lot, which is too small, and too crowded.

Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.\n\nThe food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well.

Crikey - I'm losing it, I tell 'ya.\n\nNo visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  \n\nPicnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. \n\nA large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.\n\nThe staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.\n\nDuring the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.\n\nThe gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.\n\nSo... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.

The \"buttercreams\" are made with shortening, and no butter at all.  Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term \"buttercream\" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\n\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.

No excuse for dirty.\n\nThe waitress was really nice, I think her name was Sarah.  She was personable and attentive.  She's the only reason I'd give this place a star at all.\n\nI ordered a Gyro sandwich.  It came with fries and a bowl of soup.  I ordered Broccoli Cheese soup.  I think if I heated up some Velveeta and added a gallon of water to it, then tossed in a bunch of dirty, uncut broccoli, I could duplicate the Sir Hobo recipe.\n\nI wish the rest of the meal was that good.  When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December.  I'm not joking.  The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth.  \n\nSarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking.  I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that.  \"I'll make you new sandwich,\" said the old lady. I declined.  I figured I couldn't choke down another bite of the garbage they call food.  I paid my 9 dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left.\n\nI bet the Dairy Queen across the parking lot is glad that Sir Hobo's is back open.

I call back at the end of August (it took three messages and calls to reach my salesmen) and he says he's been trying to call me but my phone was broken (it wasn't, I've had the same phone for 10 years). Then he tells me it will be September 21st. I begrudgingly agree since this is the maximum timeline in the 14 weeks. Now here we are, its the end of September and I call again today and I'm told 2-4 more weeks. I tried to talk to the manager and express my dissatisfaction and he stood there silent on the other end of the phone offering no concern or effort to expedite my shipment.   Bottom line: once the sale is final and they have your money they put zero effort in helping you.

Quite simply, there's a small bar to the left, a small VIP lounge to the right, and nothing but dance-able space in between. With a high ceiling, liberal use of bright neon blues, mirror'd-shiny surfaces, and sleek furniture, the atmosphere is energetic and cool.\n\nThe DJ, perched in a second floor booth overlooking the dancefloor, played track after track of Hip-Hop, for the most part. [From reading other reviews, I'm not sure Hip-Hop/R&B is part of the regular format. We'd been there the first week of Oct'09.] And so, the girls (Esco, RB, Becca), all talented and passionate dancers, took to the floor, wowing and attracting a perimeter of onlookers.  I danced a bit, broken ankle be darned: it'd take more than crutches to keep me from having a good time with my peeps...\n\nAs I sat for a minute, resting the cast'd ankle, a group of people complimented the girls on their style and dancing; very friendly, flattering gesture.\n\nBy 3AM, it was almost exclusively the 6 of us still on the dance floor being silly, and though we could have danced more, we had liquor at the apartment where the club had made last call around 2am.\n\nFun night and a fun little spot, but I'd suggest going with a group; friendly as people were, I'm not sure how apt this scene is to mingling/meeting/dancing with others.

During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.\n\nIt really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit.

Overall, though, it is far and away my favorite Food Fight place and a fairly reliable spot to get a good meal.\n\nMonty's food is better than hit-or-miss but not quite consistently good.  Most of the things I've eaten there, especially the breakfast foods, have been delicious (and huge), but I've had a couple of very sub-par meals (one was so bad I literally could not eat more than a couple of bites).  The things that I ate and disliked are now off the menu, so that does say something for their ability to identify what's working and what isn't.  What I can say is that the egg-based breakfast-y menu items are almost universally good.  The \"scrambled something-or-other\" never fails to disappoint, nor does the newer Blue Plate Omelet (the one with cheddar, avocado and bacon... good lord!).  And the breakfast burrito is especially good, even without chorizo (which is how I usually order it).  As for the breakfast side items, the potatoes are just okay; the biscuits are great.  Most importantly of all, the coffee is superb (even my mother thinks so and she drinks a hell of a lot more coffee than I do).  Unfortunately, I tend to shy away from the lunch and dinner items so I can't really speak to their quality.  The pies, though, are heaven.  And it's certainly worth noting that the menu pays special attention to including veg*n options.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty awesome.  Outdoor seating is spacious and comfy.  Indoors, the blue-topped tables are fun for making patterns with the wet bottom of your water glass.  Get a booth if you can; the tables are a bit cramped.  The waitstaff are generally friendly and attentive.\n\nThe upshot is that if you think you'll enjoy eating at a diner that's 70% greasy spoon and 30% hipster hot spot, and if you like breakfast foods and are a \"good orderer\" (you choose from menus wisely), Monty's is an excellent choice.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-14", "type": "review"}

Going once will not do justice! I'm from NY and it was my first time in Phoenix, so I definitely made sure I went to hear what the buzz in town was all about.\n\nThe museum is free on Wednesdays! I ended up going on a Tuesday, so I just paid the full price admission of $16. I figured, hey...why not! I'm not going to be here again for awhile.\n\nI learned so much about the lifestyle of all the different Native American reservations in Arizona and across the US.

I wanted to buy a souvenir, perhaps a piece of unique jewelry, but all the ones that caught my eye were in the $200+ range. Regardless, the knowledge I gained walking out of the museum was priceless!\n\nThe most disturbing moment for me was learning about how these Native Americans were pushed out of their lands and forced to live as \"civilized\" beings. This particular exhibit is located on their 2nd floor and did a great job in making me feel uncomfortable. \n\nThey endured torture and were forced to lose their long hair, their traditional clothing, their identity...denied the right to be who they are. Sound familiar? Sound like the racism slaves endured in the South? Well, nothing I read or hear will ever allow me to fully understand what these individuals dealt with, and probably still deal with, but knowing and understanding that this exists only makes me love the strength of the Native Americans.\n\nAll I can learn are what the pages of textbooks taught us in history class, but now that I am out of school, a museum has a way of retelling stories of the past on a whole other level. \n\nThe best part was connecting the dots about Arizona. I went to the Grand Canyon prior to my excursion in Phoenix, and I realized that a lot of the different locations in the Grand Canyon are named after these Native American tribes. \n\nI love me some education! ;)", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-31", "type": "review"}

They are much smaller and much less leg room than middle row plane seats and the person next to me was a triple large person and spilled into my seat and my husband who is normal size spilled into my other side so I think I only had 10 inches of room and was almost not able to squeeze my feet in . At intermission we jumped into the row behind us and felt very relieved they were NORMAL seats . Many elderly people attend and they drop balls of Kleenex everywhere I can't tell you how many balls of Kleenex I stepped on. The ladies bathroom  is pretty and clean but was designed terrible. You only have maybe one foot of room between the door and toilet AND THE DOOR OPENS IN so you have to hop over the toilet to get out. If you are an X-size don't even try it.\n\nNext time I will call to ask if the seats are the regular ones or the mini ones.

These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.\n\nWe could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.\n\nI had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.\n\nThe place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.\n\nPhotos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations.

For example, if you choose buttercream for your frosting, it will be smooth and sweet and creamy awesomeness in your mouth -- but on the cake, any colors will run and it can't hold complex shapes, so you're limiting yourself to very simple designs. Other frosting options exist, such as fondant and rolled white chocolate, and they each have their own set of benefits and limitations as well.\n\nIf you're good at research, you have some time to kill and you know what you're looking for, you can find a lot of this information on-line -- but when you're in the midst of the overwhelming task of planning a wedding, it would be so, so much easier to just sit down with a professional who can lay out all your options and explain the benefits and limitations of each one.\n\nUnfortunately, you won't find anyone like that at Carl's Cakes. Oh, Carl seems friendly, helpful and optimistic when you first meet him. The samples he gave us at our cake tasting were better than I ever knew cake could be, and when we asked about decorations, he was quick to assure us that he could \"do anything you want\". \n\nAfter our initial meeting with Carl, we surfed the Net for examples of memorable wedding cakes and cherry-picked the ideas we liked best until we had put together the perfect cake design. I'll admit it was on the moderately complicated side, but nothing exceptional by wedding cake standards; and after Carl's repeated assurances at the tasting that he could \"do anything you want\", we thought we were safe.\n\nBut once he has your deposit, his attitude changes. He's difficult to get ahold of by phone, and impossible to get ahold of by email. Suddenly, any design requests more complicated than the average birthday cake are answered with a simple \"I can't do that\". Even something as simple as multiple colors will be refused on the basis that the colors will bleed together. He never tries to suggest compromises or alternatives, and if you ask for them, he'll only tell you to come in and pick something from his generic book of designs.\n\nWhy all the limitations? Because Carl frosts his cakes with buttercream frosting -- and ONLY buttercream frosting.\n\nI've lost track of how many hours we spent on the phone going back and forth with Carl over the cake design, struggling to find something he could do that didn't leave us cold. Dealing with him wasted a large portion of the limited time we had to plan our wedding, and drastically increased our stress during an already stressful time. If I was rating his business purely on Customer Service, I'd have to give him 1 star.\n\nBut I'll also give credit where credit is due. In the end, he delivered our cake on time, in the flavors, size and design that we eventually agreed to. It was beautiful, if vastly simplified from our original design, and the flavor? To this day, our wedding cake is still the best thing I've ever had in my mouth. If I were rating his business purely on taste, I'd have to give him 5 stars. Heck, I'd give him 6 if it were possible.\n\nSo if you want the best cake you've ever had in your entire life, consider Carl's Cakes -- But consider very carefully. Give him an exact cake design and make ABSOLUTELY SURE he can do it without modifications BEFORE you give him a dime.", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-26", "type": "review"}

When the occasion calls for it I upgrade to a purse.  But most of time I am traveling with munchkins with insatiable appetites, so I've got snacks in there for them and/or lots of books.  \n\nWe go to this theater all the time, and I take my back pack there all the time too.  But this time it created a problem.  \n\nWe got our tickets and were happily standing at the concession counter ordering tons of overpriced, bad for you, food when this teeny, tiny, little teenage employee approached me and advises me that they are going to have to search my back pack.  WTF??\n\nThey got a homeless guy out front smokin' a doobie with some teenagers, but they want to search my stuff?!?!  But you see I was wrong about what they were looking for.  \n\nKnowing that I had nothing in my pack that was without prescription, (ho ho hee hee) I willingly handed it over to the mickey mouse club house member.  She opens the first big zipper and finds, OH MY GAWD!!  \n\nRICE CAKES!!!  \n\nI am so busted.  That's right she was lookin' for food contraband, not drugs!  The first thing she says is, \"yep, food\" and she hands the pack back to me looking disgusted.  She then advises me that I have to leave the pack locked in the office during the movie we came to see.\n\nBecause you know, even though we're standing there with food from the concession stand, we still might wanna eat them rice cakes instead!!!!  \n\nAt this point everyone is looking, and my fellow movie companion is standing there eating his newly purchased popcorn enjoying the live action theater.  I thought I wouldn't care if she wanted to hold on to it while I watch a movie, but my credit cards, cell phone, iPod and prescription drugs were the real items of value and that had me worried.  \n\nThankfully for me all the contents of my pack were still there when I got it back from food police.  However the movie sucked, I sat there the whole time wondering if her and her teenage friends were rifling through my pack.\n\nAll this because of rice cakes my friends.  So the next time you dare purchase some, just remember it's better to use them as target practice than to mistakenly bring them into the theater!!!\n\nEven though bringing in outside food was not my intention this time, I can say that next time I go, I think I'll wear a trench coat and inside I'll have bags of popcorn and cans of soda strapped to me so I can smuggle in the contraband and be an arsehole just for the heck of it.", "business_id": "pACm1yLb9Pwc1mOuvC3UDw", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-09-21", "type": "review"}

Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. \n\nThe Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending.

I don't know if they've changed management or service since they changed their name to Canyon Cafe but the service here frustrated me so badly I had to give it 2 stars for \"I've experienced better.\"  The wait for food is rather long most times of the day, which, at lunch time especially, can suffice as a reason NOT to go here. You definitely won't make it back to work within an hour.  \n\nBut here's the main reason I started boycotting Sam's. I went here with a friend who is allergic to cilantro once. She tried ordering 4 different things that presumably wouldn't have cilantro on them and each time she selected something the waiter just said \"That has cilantro too.\" How about helping to identify some items WITHOUT cilantro, Mr. Waiter?! When she had finally just decided NOT to eat at all, I asked the waiter if he could go ask the cook if he could make anything without cilantro so my friend could eat.  Rather than doing that, he said, \"well, I know all the ingredients in everything so that won't help.\" Nice. Finally I asked the waiter if the chef could make a quesadilla (tortillas & cheese!!!!!!) without cilantro and he STILL said no.  Do you know why? Because it's served with pico de gallo on top. HELLO?!?! just leave it off....idiot. It was really a terrible experience. Usually restaurants at least ATTEMPT to accommodate food allergies. NOT this one. \n\nTHEN, to cap it all off, I asked for parking validation for the garage when we were ready to go. All restaurants at the Arizona Center give validation for parking because why would you pay an additional $5-$10 just to eat at so-so restaurants?  The hostess responded with a simple, \"Sorry - we're out\". I had no patience left after the no-cilantro fiasco so I inquired further and finally a manager came out and said, \"Oh - no parking? - I'll go get more validations from our sister restaurant around the corner.\" He was back in 1 minute. How difficult was that? The lack of problem-solving skills among the staff here really astounded me, and for this reason, despite the fact that this place is super convenient to my job and home, I haven't been back since.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-15", "type": "review"}

We were seated right away, but waited 15 minutes for a waiter.  Appetizer arrived fairly promptly, but there was nearly a 30 minute wait after the appetizer was cleared for main courses to arrive.  \n\nWe had the Vegie Sampler as an appetizer and it was incredibly delicious - I'd go back just to order that dish!  Crispy/crunchy corn fritters, big chunks of seared tofu (which sounds sort of nasty to a meat-eater like me but was incredible!) with peanut sauce, and crispy fried vegie rolls.  This dish was the only real winner - and was way over the top with flavor!\n\nMy buddy had a tofu/vegie dish - I wish I knew what it was exactly - but on the menu it had a single pepper on it.  He ate half of it and was beading with sweat, so beware that even a \"medium heat\" dish can get pretty hot.  I asked for a vegie/chicken dish - something \"healthy\" and was told about a dish with a soy and garlic sauce.  The chicken and vegies were fairly good (a bit heavy on the cauliflower maybe) but the sauce just tasted \"off\" - not like soy/garlic at all and was odd enough that I didn't finish the dish either.  It wasn't flavorful - it didn't taste like I'd had it described - and it didn't compliment the rest of the dish.   Both of our issues with main courses are probably more personal preferences but there's also room for improvement maybe in how the dishes were described to us.\n\nI had a ginger martini and my buddy had a very tall mai tai ($6 - which was a good deal for the large glas!).\n\nSo...hit and miss...but I will try it again.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-02", "type": "review"}

Depends on your taste and budget. Some would find it gross, others would find it enchanting. It's more enchanting than gross. It is an old hotel. It's not decrepit. My room was clean and nice. Maid service was very good. The staff was polite and attentive and gave some good advice on eating nearby that checked out. Many eateries close by. The rooms are small by todays standards. I was a single, a double might feel pinched if in it much of the day. Bathrooms are old fashioned and simple, but OK. No granite counters, in fact, no counters, which, when you don't have one, you realize is pretty important. A/C was good, but you don't control it except to open/close the vent. That worked OK for me to my pleasant surprise. The room was cool on a 110 day. My biggest complaint was the WiFi. Yes, wireless, but it is \"turtle-slow\" ... dial up slow. Pages were slow to load. If you plan to work online, this wouldn't be the place for you. Otherwise, Internet access worked, but 1 star for that. The restaurant downstairs was very good. Modern. Pleasant. Vietnamese menu. I enjoyed 3 meals there. Fresh and well presented. Ahi tuna salad was very good. Healthy food for travelers. Yes, overall, the place is a little tired, but the room was AOK. It's a little adventuresome, which will fit some well. Kind of a 40's-50's feel. Nothing gross or dangerous or dirty. Convenient location downtown and clean. If you want a decent place  to stay downtown in PHX it meets a traveler's needs. I'd recommend it. I'll come back. The neighborhood is OK for downtown.

This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she'd be with me in, \"just a second.\" Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves. When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept. Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong. At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end. But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait.

We love the indoor family and warm water pools. The nursery staff is excellent. I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. \nOne advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. \nThe parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there.

Showed up at 8:30 on a Tuesday night, the hours said they closed at 9:00 so I was a little worried they wouldn't be very happy with us but we were greeted with a smile and taken to a table.  It took a little bit longer than normal for our waitress to come take our order but she was especially friendly so it wasn't too bad.  We ordered the Turtle Island Crab appetizer, I got the Beef Mangone (I didn't want something too crazy on my first adventure with Thai food!) and my friend ordered the Pad Cha Seafood.\n\nThe Turtle Island Crab was amazing!  My only issue with it is that I wanted more!  The wonton crackers were perfectly crispy, the crab and avocado blended together great and the dipping sauce that it came with was sweet with just a little kick.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it again!  My Beef Mangone was equally as impressive when it came out.  The presentation itself was beautiful and once I dug in, the flavor didn't disappoint either.  The beef was tender, the sauce had a bit of a kick but nothing crazy and the veggies were cooked perfectly and complemented the meat nicely.  I was nervous to try my friend's Pad Cha Seafood because it had been rated 3 peppers which equates to \"Thai Hot\" but I was glad I got the courage to do so because it was delicious too!  Everything was again cooked perfectly and the sauce was pretty hot but not unbearable.

When I was there they had an average of about 400 students from 6-12th grade.\n\nMorning classes (7:45am - 12:15pm) are normal academics. Performing arts are in the afternoon till 2-3pm depending on the classes. \n\nFor middle school:\nPiano is a required class during the morning.\nPerforming arts options are voice & an instrument (this includes strings I believe), OR ballet (offered off campus with transportation by the school).\nGuitar is available after 6th grade.\nJazz band & percussion ensemble is available by audition only after 6th grade.\nDrama is more of an after school program & has a fee. \n\nFor high school:\nStudents choose 2-3 classes from music (instrument, voice or piano), OR drama, OR ballet.\n\nTo get in there was a waiting list. Or was it first come first serve? Either way, be sure to put your kids name down or be there when they first open with all the necessary paper work. The slots are limited. Remember, the school is SMALL!\n\nI hear they are trying to remodel & expand. When I went there the school rented space from the church, but is in no way affiliated religiously. Other space was across the street. Yes, you cross the street back & forth to get from 1 class to the next. They even had the rule, \"No hugging in the crosswalk.\" That says something about the students lol\n\nConcerts were held in Pilgrim Hall or the actual church. Pilgrim Hall is where lunch can be eaten or a band class is held in the afternoon. Other students eat in the courtyard. A lunch truck (roach coach) came so students could purchase a lunch if they didn't bring their own.\n\nThis school had a high turn over of teachers. Every year about 25% of the faculty would either be fired or quit. That's actually a lot of teachers. This may not be the case anymore since the school officials have changed. There are teachers still teaching that I recognize from when I went there:\n- Leah Fregulia-Roberts (Head of School) used to be the pricipal\n- Brian Hawkins (11th & 12th Grade Math)\n- Kyle Kirkman (7th & 8th Grade Math) taught me\n- Diane Legge (5th Grade Piano) taught me piano when there was no 5th grade\n- Kristin Mailhiot (Vice-Principal) used to be a middle school science teacher\n\nStudents who either go to this school during HS or graduate stay involved. I would know, I'm friends with a lot of them on Facebook. They stay arts oriented a lot of the time & still talk about things currently going on at ASA.\n\nSo, why did I leave? There are a few reasons.\n- I wanted a big HS experience.\n- I wanted to go to school with more than 400 students.\n- I wanted life lessons. I didn't want to be sheltered. I wanted to see how the real world worked.\n- I wanted to go to a school where there was more than 2 guys to every 10 girls. And where those guys weren't gay. Nothing wrong with being gay. But I like boys, gay boys aren't interested in girls. See where I'm going with this?\n- I wanted to get away from the 5 hours of homework every night. I was constantly exhausted. I was 11, 12, & 13. I was still a kid. I missed my time to play... & sleep.\n- I wanted to get away from teachers who taught opinions instead of facts. Yes, this happened. Yes, I told him he was wrong for doing so. Yes, he hated me for it.\n- I hated playing an instrument. I didn't have time to practice after all that homework. I can't sing. Anything I was interested in wasn't available till a later year. Blah blah blah... I'm not creative. Honestly, I'm not.\n- I wanted more options. Different types of friends. Maybe to go to school with more than 95% white kids.\n\nWhat did I like?\n- I kept friends I made in middle school to this very day.\n- The teachers are smart & actually make friends with their students.\n- I usually loved the required summer reading choices.\n- I love how close the Burton Barr library is. Spent almost every day after school there. I knew people who worked there & am still friends with them.", "business_id": "Z9GH9bo8SHKx3oOokhHLyw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-07", "type": "review"}

I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill. \n\nVisible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.\n\nOnce inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.\n\nA big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.\n\nThe fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.\n\nWhile I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day.

I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good but this place knocked another one out of the park. I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town.\nFrom the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.\nAfter what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.\nThen fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.\nEven after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft.\nEverything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that.\nI hope to have many return visits here. My new favorite Mexican place hands down.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-16", "type": "review"}

If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.\n\nTheir other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.\n\nTheir Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.\n\nThe service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.\n\nOne day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.

I guess I could have scrapped these last few, but that's not what Yelpers do.  Is it!?\n\nThis was your typical Courtyard by Marriot.  Clean, well-run, friendly staff.  They have a good-sized pool and a big, comfortable lobby.  There were quite a few people checking in at the same time I was (the young lady at the front desk seemed a bit frazzled, but still very professional) and I was surprised how much room there was given the limited space they had cordoned off for registration.\n\nI would complain about the fact that there were only two elevators at either end of the hotel, but for this size hotel it didn't make sense to add more.  It gave the feeling that we were waiting a long time because we had only one option, but that was probably just skewed because of my impatience of wanting to get to where I was going that night.  I did take the stairs a few times when I didn't want to wait and going up and down to the third floor was surprisingly un-strenuous.  They had enough room that the staircase was very shallow.  Actually, a very unusual setup.\n\nI was a little disappointed in the morning when we were trying to get breakfast.  Like the first Marriot we stayed on the outbound part of our trip, there were waffle makers, but these weren't self-serve.  There was an area for a \"chef\" to make you eggs/omelette, but there was no one manning the station.  Granted, it was early.  But still.  If you're going to have a station like that, shouldn't there be *someone* there?\n\nEven with that, we had a nice stay.

I  then read the reviews and I fretted the entire time before we arrived.  Luckily when we got there it wasn't as bad as I had anticipated.  The lobby is beautiful, the pool area is very nice, the pool was very large too.\n\nThe room was just ok.  I hate that they only have double beds or one king bed as bed options.  But, we were traveling with a two year old so the double beds worked as one of us slept with our son while the other got a bed to themselves.  The beds were not super comfortable, they felt like they had been around for quite some time. Our room had been remodeled but the wallpaper was peeling from the walls already.  I can promise that is because there is a serious humidity issue in this hotel.  Our room was CONSTANTLY damp.  We turned the air down to 68, we tried warmer, but to no avail, it just stayed damp.  When you laid your head on the pillow it felt damp.  The bad thing about this is we were staying here four days.  Our swimming suits never dried out the entire time we stayed at this hotel.  They ask that you turn off the AC when you leave the room and turn it back on when you return.  I refused to do that with the humidity issues that were present and yet the maid service turned our AC off two days we were there.  \n\nThere is a Starbucks in the hotel, but, I never once saw it open.  The pool area was lovely, but, it was quite cold when you initially got in, but once acclimated it was okay.

She's been coming here for several years so I knew that this place had something going for it, and boy it really did. For our lunch stop, we ordered the general tso's chicken, kung pao chicken, and the house special chow mein. All were above average, but the general was beyond expectations. The breaded chicken pieces were out of this world-- soft, pillowy (yes pillowy) and simply addicting with each bite. If you're into Chinese like I am, you know that many general tso's chicken dishes tend to be overly breaded, crusty, and include questionable chicken parts rolled into one. Not this place! You gotta check it out. As for the kung pao & house special, they both could have had more umff and kick to it, but good nonetheless.\n\nThe only thing we worried about as we enjoyed our 3 dishes was the lack of patrons. We got here just before 2pm on a Wednesday and there was only one customer and a few pickup orders. What's the dealio Madison? I've been to nearly all the Chinese joints in Madison and this place for sure ranks pretty high. To our assurance, the lady owner said they were swamped the other day so that made us feel slightly better. \n\nBesides the great food, their prices are more than reasonable and the service is genuinely inviting. The lunch menu doesn't include anything over $5.95, which includes an entree, rice, and soup. The lady owner (who recognized my sister from previous visits) talked with us for quite some time and enjoyed playing with my baby nephew while we ate. All in all, a great visit that will definitely make me come back for more. ^^", "business_id": "uzJ2Vefb951El2oneQI8NQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-07", "type": "review"}

There is a wide variety of vegetarian options which is nice.  I also have to mention that I won't be eating here again soon as they have very recently taken my 2 favorite items off the menu; the tuna steak sandwich, and the cajun chicken sandwich.  The cumin chipotle mayonnaise on the tuna sandwich was one of the only reasons I would even still go to Monty's.\n\nThe service is always terrible.  you can count on a long wait for your waiter to take your order, for them to bring your drinks, and your food, and the longest wait of all is always for the check.  I have contemplated a dine and dash many times.  I counted the minutes one time, and it was 45 minutes from the time I finished eating to when the check came.  It wasn't because the waitress didn't see me from behind the counter either, she was talking to another server.  Once, I was eating with a friend, and we were waiting for 15 minutes to even have our waiter come to the table, so we just left.   Believe me, the service being slow is never because there isn't enough servers or too many diners.   \n\nThe food is decent, but it's not great by any means. It is still pretty okay, although I've had some bad meals.  The meatless meatloaf is only saved by the cashew gravy, and the salmon cakes are awful.  The tuna sandwich was really good, but the size and bun has changed over the years, and recently been replaced by 3 kinds of pastrami sandwiches.

I was pretty impressed with the new menu when my husband and I moved back downtown after a year in Tempe.  Back downtown, we rekindled our habit of getting tickets at the AMC then sitting around for a couple hours next door at Pizzeria Uno before the movie.\n\nThis isn't just pizza anymore.  They have a variety of healthier options, salads, pastas, burgers, and just about anything that you can think of getting at any typical American chain restaurant.  I'm not a big fan of chains, but I'm excited to see the changes made to their menu.\n\nWe decided to get an appetizer of wings (because we're from Buffalo, and that is the way of our people) to start off the meal.  When the waiter said they only had one type of sauce, \"Buffalo,\" I had my reservations about how authentic or even decent these wings would be.  So we ordered the smallest size of 8 wings figuring that even if they were not what we expected that we wouldn't feel to hosed with 8 wings.  They were actually good!  The hubby even said if he knew how good they were going to be, he would have just ordered a large order for himself.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, these are not the best wings, but they are more than adequate and at the very least good.  The sauce is not Frank's and Butter, but it was a reasonable facsimile: a little hot, a little vinegary.  We asked for them to be cooked crispy and they did, but I can't confirm if that's how they would come if you don't ask.\n\nThe rest of our meal was tasty, quick and as ordered as it has been every other time we've eaten here.

The noise then picks up again and our server comes by to drop off our check.  We're told that our meal is comped by 50%, which I'll obviously take, but that nothing was being done about the noise because the manager didn't hear anything.

I knew this cause the phone was tan/beige colored.  It was yucky.  Also, the tub liner in the first room was filthy.  Another thing I wish this hotel would change is installing fans in the bathrooms!  My boyfriend also pointed out that the sheets on the bed were super starched.   If you moved it sounded like sandpaper on sandpaper.  Madness.  I did have a odd triangle shaped hole in the sheets on my side of the bed...so that was less than plesant too.  Oh ,also the hot tub was down for maintence when we were there :( Bummer.  But the pool was open and no one was in it.

The first time we had a very large party and the service was great! We were seated quickly and served drinks and our food in a timely manner. Prior to ordering I checked out other Yelp reviews just as you are now and the things that stood out to me we're the chips and salsa and the margaritas. Well, everyone said it and I'm gonna say it too! You must try the chips and salsa (my favorite chip is the wonton chip, a little sweet heat! Yum!) and of course to go with it get the top shelf conmemorativo margarita...so, so, so good! I also got the spinach and portobello mushroom quesadilla and it was good. \n\nIt was so Delish that I brought a different large group of friends back to this place. Unfortunately, the restaurant was much busier and I'm not sure they handled the large crowds very well. We were told 1 hour wait, but after 20 minutes our buzzer went off. When we gathered our group to be seated the hostess told us it was a mistake and asked us to wait off to the side in the dining area. This wait was another hour before we approached the hostess. She was very rude and told us it would be 'awhile' but wouldn't give us a time frame. When we asked if it would be 10? 30? 1 and a half hours? She said it would be at least that! Unacceptable when we were told an hour wait. I asked to speak to a manager and Tony was extremely responsive! He worked it so that we were seated right away! The server  was fantastic as she stepped in to take our large party and we were seated outside her section. The chips and salsa came out quickly and she was great with getting us drinks (of course I had another round of the margarita) and the food was great. This time around I had the salmon. So delish! And the desserts were covered by the server as an apology for our wait. \n\nThe manager Tony was great, responsive and helped me to overcome my disappointment in the rude hostess encounter and he brought me back to a 4 star rating for the great service and food once we were seated. I would definitely recommend this place and the margarita!", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-17", "type": "review"}

It is connected to Club Downtown which has two other floors that play latin pop/rock/hip hop and reggaeton. The cover is $10. They are open til at least 3 am (and the other floors stay open even later I think) so that is an advantage over the clubs that close at 2pm. To get to the Palazzo floor, you go in through Club Downtown's main entrance and then go out on the front patio and then back in to Palazzo's dance floor. Ask if you get lost and the security or bartenders will point you there. I like the size of the floor, which is tile. It is not as hot and crowded as other salsa places like Pepins on Saturday. Drinks vary from great to weak (mainly the mixed drinks) depending on the bartender, they do have specials sometimes. As a long time salsa dancer who goes with friends (male and female) but no set partner for the night, it can be hard to find a good salsa dancer here if  you don't already know one. So salseros/salsaholics if you will be going without a partner you might want to try to find at least one good dancer to go with you so you will have fun.  Or if you look on www.azsalsa.net or www.meetup.com (check for Scottsdale or Phoenix salsa groups) there are plenty of socials and lessons where you can meet others if you are new and want to meet other dancers or go out with a group. The music is good but since I go a lot,  I start to hear the same songs over and over. I think they should bring in different djs, rotate them or make sure the music gets mixed up to keep people coming back.  Also note there is a strict dress code - it is posted outside. I know several guys who had to go back home to change cause they couldn't get in. I don't remember all the specifics but I believe some things to note are no hats/sunglasses, tennis shoes, tee shirts, baggy pants, bandanas, etc. I'd say collared shirt (tucked in), nice slacks/pants and shoes and you'd be okay. They do have metal detectors going in. However, I have rarely seen any fights and I feel safe here.

I was blissfully unaware of it until my wife decided to dedicate the rest of her life to studying indigenous cultures and schooled me on the following - For 200 years, Native Americans were seen as uncivilized beasts in need of strict re-education to meet the white man's version of civility.  Not until the 1960's (and as recently as 1990 with the passage of several federal laws including the Native American Languages Act) has the United States finally reversed course and decided to protect the various Native American cultures.  Sad, but true, and something your average American probably doesn't know and likely doesn't want to know or care to know.\n\nThankfully there are places like the Heard Museum which does a brilliant job of telling the story of many of the tribes that were located in the Southwest.  I feel it is unduly categorized as an \"Art Museum\" by many instead of an \"American History\" museum.  Yes, you get the art - in the form of pottery and jewelry and Kachina - but you also get the traditional clothing, the traditional cooking, the language component, and most importantly the history lesson.  If you leave here thinking, \"that was just a bunch of pottery and dolls\" then you've totally missed the point.\n\nThe first floor of the museum has a great flow to it with each section dedicated to a different tribe.  Obviously there are many similarities, but the most interesting things are the subtle differences between the tribes.  It also has changing exhibits on the second floor - when I was there it featured a wonderful exhibit on modern Native American art (sculpture and paintings and jewelry).  There is also a heart-wrenching exhibit on the horrific boarding schools the children were forced to attend, often far from their homes and at extremely young ages, to strip them of their cultural heritage.  My favorite part has to be the hands-on exhibit, likely meant for children but I couldn't keep away from it.  So what if I'm pushing over a 5 year old to get a pipe cleaner and tissue paper to make a flower?  There is even a section of the museum dedicated to other non-American indigenous art and garb.\n\nWhat an excellent excellent museum.  You leave much more informed and with a necessary touch of white guilt.", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-28", "type": "review"}

My Bartender was the only one behind the bar and the restaurant was pretty busy. So, as you can imagine my service was slow. I had the crab puff pastry and BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer. The Crab Pastry was very good. The BBQ Shrimp however were not. I was surprised they left the shell on the shrimp when they serve it. For my main entree I had the Coffee Crusted Chicken and a half order of jambalaya. They wouldn't let me have jambalaya as a side so I had to order half a plate of it If i wanted to try it.

I believe when a manager needs to speak to an employee about what they are doing wrong, it should be private, not discussed anywhere around costumers. He was very unprofessional and  It made me uncomfortable. I left a really good tip for our waitress because she deserved it and so do the rest of the employees there at iHop.

I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.", "business_id": "qQvpS262VPEHKZvM6j5uhQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-10-02", "type": "review"}

Both times I've gone have been for bands, and both times were fairly different experiences.\n\nMy first time was a one-star experience: it was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the bar near the window, making for awkward viewing and playing. The sound was terrible and I spent more time outside than in. \n\nMy second time was a better experience, but still not one that would cause me to suggest other people go there. This time around it was a reasonable temperature in the bar, but that may only be due to the fact that it was in the 50s outside. The bands played in the back of the bar in an alcove/side room deal and it made a lot more sense. The sound was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad. \n\nFree music is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for it. Its biggest downsides:\n- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination\n- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP\n- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck\n\nYou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's band play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside.", "business_id": "-4PHmmCt_RmAfaE3sDKW_g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-28", "type": "review"}

I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\n\nThe majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\n\nWe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\n\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\n\nThings I liked:\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\n\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\n\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\n\nThings I didn't:\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\n\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\n\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\n\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-04", "type": "review"}

Yuk.  It's so thick, it heaps up on the spoon.  I've eaten there a few times since the rebuild and it seems they are trying to change.  I hope they try a bit harder this time.\n\nA note:  No carpeting this time around.  It's very noisy.

If you are out of town the location can be a tricky as it is inside a shopping plaza.  Most of the group was about 10 mins late (I know I know...sad when most of us have GPS capable mobile phones).  We found it due to the friendly local police and Downtown Phoenix greeters (?).  \n\nThe restaurant did not have a private room (we had a group of 15) but we were there really early.  The chip basket is AMAZING!  It has a bunch of different chips from tortilla, to different types of potates and even these fried pieces of goodness (that reminded me of wontons).  The salsa was really good too.  The waitstaff was great....they provided lots of these chip baskets during our 3 hour meeting.  When the meeting concluded...it was straight to the top shelf margaritas which we've been dying for since we sat down.  It's a great deal for top shelf tequila and the quantity.  You get about 2-4 drinks as they even give you some reserve in the cocktail shaker.  \n\nFood was good.  I had the sirloin which was cooked perfect at medium.  My friend sitting next to me ordered the same thing at medium rare but got it well done.  She sent it back and after a few minutes got a new one closer to the rare side but she was happy.\n\nIf I lived in the area and was able to visit again I could consider becoming a fan of this place.

They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that \"home quality\" kind of experience. \n\nI typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable. \n\nMy other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change. \n\nThat being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an \"A-OK\" burger joint but they are far from a \"4+ star\" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and \"spunk\". \n\nThey do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well. \n\nOverall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good. \n\nOh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!!

I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.\n\nSo I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.\n\nAnyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.\n\nHalfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!\n\nThe wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.\n\nThe bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.\n\nAnyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.\n\nI had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.  When I saw the tab, I was glad I didn't have to pay.  $60+ to \"enjoy\" conversation with a tool and overpriced food and drinks.

The activities and inning breaks definitely cater towards kids, but I found myself laughing, cheering, screaming wiener at the top of my lungs. Food in my opinion is only so, so. I like that there are local options but they're not great. They can't be... it's a ballpark and they're using prep kitchens. I will say the beer options are nothing short of amazing. I also dig that players typically stick around after the game and sign stuff for the little ones. It doesn't get more local than a Mallards game, except on July 4th of this year at the Hometown Classic. What's a Hometown Classic you ask? Oh, just a head to head of central Wisconsin's minor, minor, like \"is he able to drive\" minor team players. \nSuch. A.

None of us had ever been there.\nWhile the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \"real\" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\n\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\n\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\n\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\n\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\n\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\n\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\n\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\n\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\n\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\n\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.\n\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?

If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)...do not be fooled. The corn is puuuure buttery goodness. The potato salad is also delicious! Truly, the perfect complement to the sandwich. Creamy, no skin, no dill, just the way I like my potato salads. :9\n\nAt $8.45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get. The takeout service is super quick as well - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order. Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun place to dine in as well (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths). You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!\n\nYelp recommendations for what to order as a first-timer to Smoky Jon's are on point. I can't wait to be back to try the ribs!!\n\nTip: their parking lot is tiny and shared with the bar next door, so don't expect to find any open spaces around lunch or dinner time.

Based on the crowds and the number of reviewers on Yelp, Stella's gets all the love.   However, based on my consumption of their breads and pastries while also comparing prices and customer service, Oakhouse backhands Stella's with a silicone pastry brush (granted, Stella's has the moistest and most flavorful cheese danishes in the area).\n \nI have always appreciated Oakhouse's efficiency and consistency.  They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.\n\nMy change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.  The layer offers dynamic and perfect flavor combinations vs. the eclair's often disappointing cream to pastry ratio.\n\nNext time you go to the CSFM... sting Stella's and make a beeline to Oakhouse.  They may be -1 on product marketing, but more thank make up for it on their delicious delivery.

My food was ok. The tamale was actually pretty good. It needed spice though.\n\nThe kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on. We came for a badger game. Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials. Having just received our food... Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment. Apparently, there was a UFC fight on. We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett.\n\nWe asked about the game. He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000.00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it. I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost. His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound! \n\nWorst of all was when I told him we wouldn't be returning because of this he said,\"Ok.\" \n\nHe clearly doesn't care about his customers!

Lately, I've only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that's not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \n\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \"No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we'll open additional check-out lanes!\" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\n\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they're located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That's outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That's on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It's at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It's in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There's zero organization/logic...\n\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\n\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn't have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did.

I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.\n\nWhen I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could \"saw\" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.\n\nBecause of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.\n\nEven more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \"f-ing out of here\" because he had \"the longest f-ing day of his life\" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. \n\nI now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future...", "business_id": "tgGaaLuFPbeiwPZcAKFxGA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-22", "type": "review"}

I always end up getting the Amundson Chicken Sandwich or the Chicken Ceasar Wrap...mostly so I can eat those crunchy delicious fries (similar to Yard House fries if you've had those). \n\nThe service is hit or miss...but that's ok. It's what you have to expect and just deal with it. \n\nIt's always fun for us huge Suns fans to stop in there before or after the games to see some players and coaches, watch some ESPN, and have a great time.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-13", "type": "review"}

By what I have read and now I interpreted the menu, I thought it was just fancy schmancy version of my fave Thai dishes. Since I'm not one to mess with classics, I didn't know how I'd like this spot. Wifey told me that tonight was the Thai New Year and they were going to have live music and dancers, so I figured uck it why not. What an awesome meal.\n\nWe started with the veggie sampler ($12.95) as our appetizer and a big ole $5 Thai beer. The sampler had the corn fritters, veggie egg rolls and tofu in peanut sauce. The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.\n\nFor our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce. The ONLY part I didn't totally love was the calamari, it was waaaay chewy. Every other part was perfect. The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they're supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over. \n\nThe other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to. I realized a piece of the pork, with some of the sweet carrot salad and the sauce had the total package. Wow. \n\nWe ended the meal with a stiff cocktail (I had this cosmo thing with sake, cranberry and lime juice that I had them serve me in a regular cup instead of the martini glass so I didn't look like a nancy) and wifey had a big ole slice of chocolate cake. Triple decker and all.\n\nWe ended up leaving around 720 or so, and the music was SUPPOSED to start at 7 but we didn't get to see it. Nevertheless, it was an awesome meal and I'm super stoked to have that cool Thai spot within walking/stumbling distance to the casa.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-01", "type": "review"}

I wonder if people go to bed early around this neighborhood or if this place just isn't that popular.\n\nCoconut soup was weird .  A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.   \n\nLamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well.  The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste.  Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb.  They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt).  A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite.\n\nRice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits.  I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant.  Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there.  If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more.  \n\nI tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness.\n\nThree sauces or chutneys that came with the papadom were not very good at all. \n\nHad to ask to have my water glass filled every single time I finished it.

The fitness room has 2 treadmills, 1 recumbent bike, 1 elliptical and a few free weights, enough to get your cardio going. On the plus side you are across from the mall so it makes it easy to grab a bite walking distance and free wi-fi is available throughout the hotel.", "business_id": "Hh5lyZtOrS5LKk4YCgj8Kw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-15", "type": "review"}

However, when we went back a month or so later, we had a horrible experience.  We had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and then when we got it- it was terrible.  My boyfriend had the garlic chili fries and they arrived not only COLD, but DOUSED in disgusting grease- they were inedible.  We mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring a new order, but it turned out the new order was just as terrible as the first one.  I had the roast beef sandwich and it was horrible- very dry and bland.  To her credit, the waitress did give us free cupcakes to take home to make up for the horrible food (although it turned out the cupcakes were also inedible and terrible).  \n\nWe hoped this was just an unusually busy night and not the norm, and because the fish fry is so good, we went back again tonight, hoping for a better experience.  We were wrong!  We went around 7 and waited 15 min or so for a table.  Once we were seated we placed our order right away with the waiter, since we already knew what we wanted.  An hour later, we were still waiting for our food.  All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer.  When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable.  After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes.  We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore.  Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner.  It's too bad because the fish is good, but not good enough to justify the SLOW service.\n\nEdit: Turns out the fish wasn't so good- ended up being up all night with food poisoning.  Yup, definitely will NOT be going back there for dinner!", "business_id": "HTplzElel_F_U_qhWuDKdg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-27", "type": "review"}

They like it, and they have the bread that's pretty good, but the menu isn't really the same and I was disappointed that they had only three soup options.\n\nFor an appetizer, they give you a pretty decent tasting bread. It's soft and there is olive oil to go with it. They brought us two baskets for our table of 4. Not bad.\n\nI wanted to order soup, but all they had was Tomato Basil and Minestrone. Neither of those sounded really appealing so I ordered Portabella Penne. She asked if I wanted a salad or soup to add, and I asked what my options were. It's a house salad or a Caesar salad, but there is an upcharge, which she didn't tell me. I thought perhaps it was like Olive Garden and it came with the meal, but no. It was extra. \n\nAs I said in my other location, definitely order the dressing on the side. I practiced that again and boy was I happy I did or it would have been drowning.\n\nOverall, it wasn't terrible, but it was nothing to write home about.

The majority of the laughs were in the first half of the play, but as a whole very amusing, entertaining, great performances and solid writing. It made for a fun start to our Saturday night.\n\nLike most theaters, symphony halls, performance centers, etc., they serve coffee, beer, wine and a few select liquors, which must be consumed before entering the actual theater. Likewise, I love the fact that one can purchase drinks (wine for us) for the intermission and the drinks will be poured and waiting for you without standing in line again. Bonus, considering the intermission may be your only opportunity for a restroom break.\n\nThe chairs are very comfortable within the theater and there really is not a bad seat in the house, considering it is a very small theater. I have two complaints, though, which are totally fixable in which case I would easily rank this theater 5 stars...\n\n1) The temperature was very pleasant outside, between say 60 and 65 degrees. Inside, however, we were sweating. It wasn't a dripping sweat but if you choose to \"dress up\" to go to the theater, you might be uncomfortable, as we were.\n\n2) My second complaint is about the website and the frustration in navigating around to find seating charts that don't suck. Right now it's a crappy, what they consider, 3D seating chart that when clicked on will show you the available seats. The problem is, it doesn't work very well. It's just not clear. It's sad when you google seating charts for the theater and ticket brokers have a better seating diagram than the theater itself. So do yourself a favor and do what I did, find a good seating chart and call the box office. It's quicker and you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nMy thoughts on the best seats....the floor seats seem to be good and close. But I chose mezzanine  because I like the looking-down view. If you do choose one of the balconies, I recommend in front of the stage and the 1st row. If you sit on either side of the stage, you'll inevitably end up leaning forward in your seat and resting your elbows on the ledge in front of you to get the best view, doesn't seem that comfy. And I say front row because we sat center stage on the second row and my friend had a hard time seeing over or around the big hair in front of her. Just saying.\n\nGreat experience overall. Small venue, has a laid back feel to it with some folks choosing to dress to the 9's while others were comfortably wearing jeans. I'll be keeping my eye out for other plays that might interest me, as I will certainly return to this theater.", "business_id": "RA2EuX04SHqmayKpLhpNvA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-14", "type": "review"}

It's largely a \"self-service\" type place, which is fine by me.  You place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive.  When you're done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the \"dish basket\" and head on your merry way.\n\nThe pancakes aren't anything spectacular - just your regular \"mix made\" pancakes.  They're cooked well, with nice color, and are \"plate size\" so one or two should be plenty for most folks.  They're not obscenely thick; in fact, they're a bit on the thin side, come to think of it.\n\nBreakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin.\n\nI've also had the Wright Breakfast and today, I had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast.  Again - it was good, but not \"out of this world great.\"\n\nThey're currently serving Alterra-brand coffee; another review references Ancora, but it looks like they've switched to Alterra.  It's good coffee, nonetheless.\n\nStaff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal.  They don't take credit/debit cards - it's cash or check only.  There's a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice.  There tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren't your thing, steer clear on Saturday and Sunday.  I had the joy of listening to two screaming kids during my entire meal this morning - the parents were oblivious... \n\nMy biggest gripe?  Price.  My breakfast this morning (\"special\" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14.10.

I walked down the street from hotel room and headed towards a highly rated steakhouse.  But, when I saw the prices and weighed my hunger - I thought better about it.  Next door, I found Wild Thaiger which was also highly rated and seemed like a better choice.  I was right!!  I sat down at the bar and was quickly helped by the friendly waitress.  I flipped through the menu and saw all the usual Thai fare - but one specialty stuck out to me...  a spicy wild boar dish.  I was in and the waitress double checked to be sure I was aware about the spiciness of the dish.  Armed with a beer and water, I dove in for a fantastic feast.  I didn't notice the sliced thai chilies that adorned the dish until I really dug in.  Phew!!  It was spicy and it was delicious!!!  The wild boar appeared and tasted like tender slices of pork.  The sauce was flavorful and the chilies gave it a great kick.  The Thai girls in the kitchen were pleasantly surprised to see me finish the plate without suffering too much.  In fact, I LOVED it.  \n\nI don't really spend much time in Phoenix, but I will revisit Wild Thaiger if I am near by.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-04", "type": "review"}

I have been here multiple times and have yet to find someone who is polite or pleasant to talk to.

When I tried to protest the woman at the counter told me she \"clearly knows more about this\" than I do. I came back a few weeks later to sell another manual that had ICDM on the front and the girl actually tried to tell me that meant there was a CD that was supposed to go with it. I tried one more time to sell some novels and after the clerk gave me a pay slip he threw my book in the garbage right in front of me.

I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review.\n\nThis is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. \n\nThe area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. \nBy the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. \nI'll skip some details here, and make a long story short:\n\nI puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The Chinese/Colombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that.\nAfter he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue.\nShortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. \n\nThe point of this whole review is this:\nLadies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means.", "business_id": "EmzaQR5hQlF0WIl24NxAZA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-12", "type": "review"}

The drinks however were BOMB (margarita with cranberry, lime, and prickly pear juice), both frozen and iced. Our server was super sweet and chatted it up with us which was nice. I don't know if I'd make the trip back for dinner, but if I was in the area I'd definitely come back for a margarita and some appetizers.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-03", "type": "review"}

We 'd been looking for a good BBQ place in Madison, and Smoky Jon's was the first place we tried.  Needless to say, we won't be trying any place else!\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.\n\nOh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.\n\nThe sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.\n\nSmoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison.

This had been my go-to place for beans-and-rice Mexican in Madison for the better part of two decades, and I had converted my wife into a Pedro's fan. I'd had past or present Madison residents take issue with my insistence that Pedro's was a great casual dinner place, but I took that as part and parcel of Madison's legendary pretentiousness toward anything that's not \"edgy,\" such as old-school Americanized Mexican food.\n\nUnfortunately, it turns out any snobbery against Pedro's may be justified. My wife and I stopped in for the first time in 3 or 4 years and we were both sorely disappointed with our experience. The burrito is smaller than it used to be -- I suppose that's how they've been able to hold the line on prices so the size reduction is probably justified -- but my wife's fajitas were chewy, and both dishes lacked that \"kick\" that they used to have. Our quesadilla appetizer arrived luke-warm and was nearly rock-hard within minutes.\n\nThe premises haven't changed in the nearly 20 years I've been eating there and it's starting to show its age. Service was adequate, no more no less. which would be fine if everything else up to par.  In short, Pedro's lacks that extra spark that used to make it worth a special stop when visiting or passing through town. Not to mention the Mexican cuisine options have exploded in Madison in the last 20 years, so one would think Pedro's would need to step up their game rather than rest on their laurels.

Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. There are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.\n\nTangles Salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the Madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.\n\nAfter a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\n\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\n\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\n\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.", "business_id": "mbtGl2I2A2To-8jiggN99g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-08-30", "type": "review"}

The race began Friday, so we arrived late Thursday afternoon and left in the morning.\n\nReservations were made months in advance and were honored when we got there. Check-in was simple and the employees seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm and joking around. They even welcomed us with fresh cookies. How can you hate on a hotel with cookies? You just can't.\n\nThe location, strangely enough, was both ideal and not. The nice thing was that we were close enough to the starting line that it wasn't a huge issue for our first group of runners to leave at 5am and get there on time; however, being somewhat closer to where the race started might have been nicer and we're looking into that for 2013, because it was a bit of a haul for the second van (my van).\n\nOn the other hand, we were far enough away that this hotel did not fill up immediately and it had no problem blocking off some rooms for us and we were right off the highway, very close to restaurants for an easy group dinner and there is a shopping center right next door. I took full advantage of stocking up on anything I might have missed by going to the local Erehwon and running shop. That was incredibly convenient. They also have a really good continental breakfast.\n\nAs far as the hotel room: the beds were incredibly comfortable but the shower drain was backed up. I ended up in a couple inches of dirty water, which is never fun. However, I had some of the best sleep of my life. The area remains relatively quiet and the curtains keep out most of the light.\n\nPrices are very reasonable, so this is a great place to stay if you want to be near Madison but don't need to be right in the city.", "business_id": "naqkXvhoqljvA7kuo15gEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-01", "type": "review"}

And I love it. The servers are friendly, the place is beautiful, the best part is the outside patio. The only two negative things are the small bar area (happy hour is only in the bar) and the birds. The birds are cute, very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips.\n\nThe food was great, I got the enchiladas which were tasty and I asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that. A friend got the Tuna salad which she enjoyed. I am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good. The chips that come to your table are okay, I'm not a fan of the sweet potato chips, the texture and taste just do not work for me. So when I go I ask if I can just get corn tortilla chips, and they are happy to do that too. The salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good, but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good.. maybe better\n\nThe best part of this place is the Happy hour. The drinks are cheap and tasty. The best is the Grand Canyon Margarita which a mixture of orange, cranberry and prickly pear juices, its strong and only 3 bucks. The regular margaritas are excellent, on mondays that have a 10 dollar pitcher deal, a friend and I were able to get three each out of the pitcher. Good thing she lives in walking distance to the place. \n\nAnother good thing about the happy hour is the food. The bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu. The best thing on that list is the chicken nachos, so good, best nachos I've had in a long time. Another is the cheese crisp with carnitas, very tasty.  Most of the items on this menu are around five dollars, and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two. \n\nI would highly recommend this place.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-14", "type": "review"}

I've stayed in Madison plenty of times for work, and overall, this is the nicest hotel that I've stayed at.  Pros: staff are very nice and friendly.  Hotel has gym, pool, and business center at no additional cost.  You know how some hotels have that teeny tiny kiosk to print your boarding pass, and that's all you can do?  There are 2 computers hooked up to printers so can you do real tasks like check your email, Yelp, etc.  The beds are VERY comfortable.  It shocked me how nice they were.  Bathrooms have stone countertops and something heating the mirror, so that after a shower your mirror is still usable, not all fogged up.  Someone had their thinking hat on.  The hotel is walkable to several restaurants & I think they provide room service, but they will also help you order from a nearby restaurant if you arrive late in the evening.\n\nFor a hotel this size, they do a really good job with breakfast.  It's a buffet with the usual cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries, and hot food.  But they really go an extra mile on the eggs, and every egg dish is cooked to order.  Whether you want 1 scrambled egg or full omelette, they'll make it for you fresh, give you a table tent number, and then bring it to you.\n\nI have 2 more trips this year to Madison, and hope I'm staying here again!", "business_id": "MBQc_jlZ3nlMOZy7SUM_5Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-18", "type": "review"}

But in the last few years, other venues in Madison have really stepped up their game, and the Barrymore doesn't seem to care about keeping up with its contemporaries.\n\nIts use of social media is near-archaic. The venue doesn't make an effort to create or even update pages for individual events, and good luck if you get any indication that a show is on track to sell out. And perhaps it's just my personal taste, but the Barrymore used to bring in excellent music acts on a much more regular basis. Now it just caters to the aging-hippie population of the neighborhood, preferring to fill its schedule with predictable offerings about far-left-leaning politics. These events don't offend my own political views, but they're often dull and serve as nothing more than an echo chamber for people who want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed. They sell more tickets that way, so I'm not sure I can blame them for the strategy, but  I hardly ever like the shows there. Also, the tickets are 2-3 times more expensive than the tickets usually are at other live entertainment venues in town.\n\nThe building itself isn't falling into disrepair, like the Orpheum is (heartbreakingly, I might add), but areas of infrastructure could certainly benefit from attention. There is no public WiFi, and you'll be hard-pressed to get cell phone reception, even in the balcony. I do appreciate that the open dance area is slanted a bit so that we vertically-challenged folks have a chance to see, but if you want to be able to sit and see the acts, the balcony is your best bet. It's not often open, however, especially for shows that haven't sold a ton of tickets. I don't recall this being a problem at prior events, but at the show I attended last night, there were constant problems with microphone feedback, often necessitating acrobatics by the band itself. The tap beer selection is good, but that's pretty standard in this town. Bottled beer selection pales in comparison to other venues, and the liquor and wine options are slim pickings. The bar is cash-only. The only ATM in the place charges a $4 fee for each use, so if you need to withdraw cash, make sure to get enough in one go. The line can be enormous, and often is bisected by people exiting and entering the theater. The bathrooms are fairly clean and well-stocked, although I've used them on more than one occasion to discover that they were out of soap, necessitating the use of their hand sanitizer instead.  Also, the saloon-style doors are an easy way to get smacked in the face entering and exiting the bathroom, so exercise plenty of caution around them. The bathrooms are so tiny that the lines are formed outside the doors. They also don't sell earplugs, so make sure you bring your own.\n\nBottom line: in the rare event that they have a show I want to see, I'll go, but I make sure to bring plenty of cash, my own earplugs, and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back).", "business_id": "f5ntGOT9_0pCdeUaUVi9cg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-29", "type": "review"}

So he responded, \"Oh, well, I need an address to get a cab to you.\" I ended up looking through a stack of torn up phone books searching for the address while he held a conversation with one of his co-workers.

I used to be heavily involved in bike racing about 20 years ago, but becuase of the sport changing so much to this date, I once again went to the Village Peddler to ask the experienced and knowledgeable staff at VP. Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!\n\nEach of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional. Both Gary and Mike spent about 25 minutes with them, which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores. I have been in customer service myself for over 20 years, so it definitely takes a lot to impress me! \n\nI have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number, when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line. When I am considering spending a large amount of money, if I am not impressed with your customer service, you have definitely lost the sale. In this case, we as a family were treated excellent, and coming from a guy in his 40's, I don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great, but in the case it most definitely was. \n\nWe added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere. Once we were done, both guys wheeled the bikes out and helped us secure them in the truck conveinently out a side door of their shop. While in the store, I picked out a couple of bikes that I am intersted in, and soon as have time, you can bet that I am going to head back and buy the one that makes the most sense. When I have a good experince shopping, I tend to tell everyone I know, and this time will be no different.

I can't speak for its authenticity or service, but I can speak for how often I find myself hungry, cold, and ordering from China Wok's online delivery system. \n\nI don't generally care for Sweet & Sour anything. That's not real food!  Have you seen that toxic-waste colored, gelatinous red sauce?  That can't be good for you.  But on a friend's recommendation, I tried it from China Wok. It's delicious. Somehow the battered and fried chicken had not become soggy during delivery, and I found it was insanely addictive over pork fried rice. (I like their fried rice- not too greasy. But it seems to turn bitter when you re-heat it the next day.)\n\nDecent dumplings, and my BF seems to enjoy the spare ribs, since those are the only two things he ever orders from there. The sauce that comes with those dumplings is pretty awesome I must say. I also enjoy the crab rangoons, though they are the very creamy kind with almost no actual crab meat. Ask me if I care. Because I don't. \n\nReally, I've probably had 75% of the menu by now, and nothing really sticks out as \"not good.\"  Though once we tried the Teriyaki Chicken and found it to be pretty dry. Who knows if that is how it usually is, since we only tried it once. What business did we have ordering Japanese food from a Chinese place anyway?\n\nThey are reliable, fairly priced, good size portions, hot when it arrives, completely non-threatening Chinese.

Overall I had a really good experience and experienced none of the negative issues noted in other reviews. Most of the decor in my room appeared to have been updated in recent years, including the large flat screen TV.  A few things were clearly older, but I got the impression they were gradually being improved. The bed was comfortable and there was an assortment of pillows. The shower was fine. The staff were very friendly, not only the folks at the front desk but also the cleaning crew. The Wifi was free and fast. There is a Starbuck's with limited hours in the hotel itself, but there is a full service one just a few hundred yards down the road. Also within easy walking distance is a large mall and some great places to eat (including Mexican and Japanese). The workout room includes two treadmills, an elliptical, a recumbent bike, some dumbbells, a bench, and a couple mats. The machines were older but of good quality. I stayed a Saturday night and there was a wedding at the hotel, but I had absolutely no issues with noise. Overall I was quite satisfied. I should also mention that they have a free shuttle van that will take you anywhere within a 3-mile radius. It leaves every hour or half hour.  I have never stayed in a hotel with that service before.

For a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  The buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  I stopped by this weekend while shopping at Greenway Station and found the store devoid of patrons.  I know it's been a long, cold winter, but we Wisconsinites love our ice cream and Babcock Hall was standing room only when I visited later that same day.\n\nSo why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew Cold Stone?\n* Texture - I really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that's not what you get at Cold Stone.  The texture is far too gooey for my liking.  It's not terrible, but I much prefer the denser texture of the product at Babcock Dairy or The Chocolate Shoppe any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \n \n* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.\n\n* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \"Like It\", \"Love It\" and \"Gotta Have It\" serving size names.\n\n* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \"Ice cream, baby\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\n\n* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.

Although I never felt like the service was great there, the prices were good and they seemed to care about the dogs, so I kept coming back. \n\nI don't know if something changed, but over time my dog started coming back sore and covered in blood. He started acting terrified whenever I would pull up front, and it was clear he was having bad experiences there. I asked the owner about this, and she said that nothing was going on and that he played well with other dogs. \n\nWell two months ago, my healthy four year old dog came back barely able to walk. It took weeks before he recovered, and he still hasn't seemed himself. I can't help but wonder what goes on there, but it seems like something fishy is going on. \n\nTo make matters worse, I boarded him at a different kennel last weekend. The owner immediately called me after I dropped him off and explained that he was acting traumatized and terrified of the kennel. He said it was very obvious he was not suited for kennels. \n\nUnfortunately, he also told me that some kennels are known for taking dogs that don't do well and lying to the owners to keep the business. When I mentioned Hickory Hills, he laughed and said they were the worst kennel in Madison. He also told me a story about how the owner or manager killed several dogs by leaving insect poison out in the play area.\n\nI feel so lucky my dog wasn't more hurt at this horrible kennel, and I hope nobody else has to lose a beloved pet to this sub-par facility.

Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\n\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\n\nThe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\n\nThis Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.\n\nThis Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\n\nOn weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\n\nThe front desk was nice and helpful.\n\nRoom rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.\n\nThis Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.\n\nThis Marriott has its own free parking lot.

It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.\n\n- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit\n\n- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. \n\n- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. \n\n- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit.

I want a pair!!\n\nWhen it comes to the Heard's Gift shop: now this place is amazing!! Many of their pieces are authentic and hand crafted. BUT THERE ARE FAKES AMONG THEM!!! Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they're made out of! \n\nThere could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.\n\nTheir exhibits are always changing. So check the website and see what's new. Have fun, bring a friend, and open your mind and see the many wonderful facets of Native American Culture.\n\n****UPDATE****\nOne of our fellow yelpers Deb K. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sGzHUN7UpjXUGKckrv-bTw has sent me private messages asking me to edit my review and I am! She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard's Gift Shop. \n\nShe has said and I quote: \"Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic.\"  and she even goes on to say, \"Maybe you're thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment. [although I do agree they're kind of tacky, but you know the bilagaanas (White People)...they do like their kitschy stuff]\" And what really got me was: \"I really feel you should go back and change the part about the shop offering 'fake' items\". \n\nAs a Native American, sometimes it's a love/hate relationship with the Heard. The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it's allowed and it's a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. \n\nThere is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don't complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it's nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I'm so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.\n\nLike I said - it's a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it's an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be \"let in\" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we're obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.\n\nTo my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it's own ways and unique culture.

I've logged over 50 nights at this hotel so I think I'm decently qualified to offer a balanced review.  This last stay will be my last overall.  Although the staff is generally friendly & professional, their competence is questionable.  I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  It greatly lacks attention to detail.  I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.  This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason.  I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work.  I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  All of the power in the room was then knocked out.  This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  I was lucky my computer was not fried.

The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.

Olbrich is a free botanical garden! Sure, the growing season here is very limited (even Milwaukee and Chicago have longer seasons!), but that is no reason to detract a star from a place because of the weather! \n\nThis place is gorgeous and the flora/fauna you might be inclined to visit depends on the time of year...the Thai Pavilion is probably the exception as the gold leaf and smooth stones stand out at anytime of year. (Did you know there are no nails in the entire structure? I think that is so amazing!) \n\nThe Bolz Conservatory is also open year round. It includes tropical plants as well as many species of smaller creatures be them mammal, bird, or butterfly. While the Gardens in Chicago or Domes in Milwaukee might run you a pretty penny, the Conservatory costs only $2. The gigantic koi, the exotic trees, and not even to mention being the cheapest sauna in Wisconsin! This place is so worth it! I adore it and still pickup the 'kids-only' scavenger hunt.\n\nEverything about this place is delightful. Also, I have navigated this place, with the exception of the rock garden, with a wheelchair. So for those concerned about others who cannot walk far or without assistance, there are many benches and areas for a rest! Did I mention that it is free?

For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?

It's much better and more informative. After you finish his, then read mine. Ok? It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.\n\nI was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...\n\nThe Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. \n\nThe founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.\n\nMost people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.\n\nSo, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright.

No one has reviewed this place yet?\n\nJenifer Street is the go-between market for those of us who don't necessarily want to shop at Woodman's but also don't want to spend a lump of cash at the Co-Op.  The selections here are good, the meats aren't bad (though they have far fewer local selections than they should), and the beer corner is just awesome.  Seriously, the beer corner is the best part of this store.  They even provide jackets for people to wear.  If that doesn't get you here, nothing will.\n\nThe produce is a mix of local and not, but it's a good mix.  I go here for pretty much everything when I don't want to drive too far for something.  The Co-Op is great, but it just charges FAR too much for a lot of things.  That is what drove me to Jenifer Street in the first place, and I've never looked back.  Sure, I still hit the Co-Op up for some things, but they're the things I know I can only get there.\n\nAnyway, this store is great and it's a neighborhood fixture.  It's cash only, but there is an ATM at the front door and when you get money out of it, you get a $1 coupon for shopping at the store.  That gives you the $1 back that the ATM took from you to get the cash.  VERY nice touch!!\n\nOverall, this is THE place I go to when I want to hit up a non-major outlet on the near Eastside.

Decent sides, cheap drinks, decent service, but extremely tiny and easily packed - especially on Friday nights.\n\nDetailed review: the fish fry fanatics crew selected Toby's Supper Club as the target for our taste buds this week.  We were \"warned\" by a co-worker that it was a \"local/townie\" type place, but it didn't deter us.  We ventured out to Toby's, found a parking spot, and muscled our way into the place.\n\nI say \"muscled\" because the place was PACKED.  We arrived at around 7:30pm that evening; we didn't get seated at a table until nearly 10:00pm... It was ridiculously full.  And hot.  Too many people and not enough A/C, for sure!\n\nDespite the packed-to-the-gills nature, we were quickly served by the bartenders.  Talk about \"machines\" - the two folks that were tending the bar were going non-stop, multi-tasking, and never missing a beat.  May not have been the friendliest service, but they were literally giving change while mixing a drink and taking at least 2 additional orders... all at once.  Free pretzels were a nice touch as well.\n\nOh, and did I mention the drinks were cheap?!  Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour: $3.  Beers - dunno, but we drank for 3 hours on $30.  That's good by my book.\n\nThe ordering process is interesting... you'll be sitting/standing at the bar, and out of nowhere will appear a waitress.  She'll take your order and will then grab you when your food and table are both ready.  We ordered: Baby Pike, Cod, and Lake Perch with a side of cheesy hashbrowns.\n\nAs mentioned, the wait was incredibly long - at least 2.5 hours.  But it was worth it.  Our table became available, we were seated, and we enjoyed a pre-dinner salad (nothing fancy, but fresh and tasty), and the customary carrots/celery/radish/green onion bowl of veggies.\n\nThe fish arrived, and wow.  Wow - that's about all I can say.  So wonderful.  Lightly breaded, fried to perfection, and not a single hint of grease.  Served piping hot, to boot.  What we all liked about the fish was the fact that the fish was actually the star - the breading wasn't overdone and it didn't steal any of the thunder from the fish.  \n\nThe hashbrowns were huge and perfectly cooked - dark/crispy brown crust with a perfectly melted cheese blend on top.  Just a hint of grease, but we're picking nits here...\n\nThe bill arrived - $44 for the three of us, including another round of drinks.  Our server, Rhonda, was absolutely stellar as well - she took fantastic care of us, and it turns out that her son and his girlfriend were the bartenders.\n\nSummary: Toby's Supper Club = WIN\n\nFood: 4.5 - 4.75 stars\nService: 4.5 stars\nValue: 4.5 stars\nAtmosphere: 4.5 stars (classic supper club: paneling, dark wood)\nMisc: Dinged slightly for the long wait and sauna-like heat\n\nSummary: It's worth the wait to get fish here on Friday nights.  Just dress comfortably, bring some cash for the bar, and be prepared to wait.", "business_id": "FIR1SRvSAMNTO3VvNaJn2g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-12", "type": "review"}

First of all, it was July and for people like us who live in Arizona, the heat is here to stay and we learn to deal with it. However, for visitors from all around, the 110 degree weather means that they will not eat outside. So we had the choice to wait for an indoor table or take the patio seating that had immediate seating -- and I mean, every seat was available on the patio. The hostess looked at us like we were crazy as we took the patio and we proceeded to order food. Now, contrary to common belief, just because a sports bar is named after an athlete, doesn't mean that athlete frequents there every day. But on this particular day, Dan Marjele happened to walk into Marjeles. The irony cracked us up because we knew that the out of towners probably assumed this is a regular occurrence. And hey, maybe it is! \n\nAnyway, this is the perfect bar to grab a quick and decent bite to eat before a sporting event downtown. The buffalo chicken is delicious, as is the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich and any other wrap on the menu. It's one or two notches above generic bar food and the drinks also flow nicely. They have plenty of TVs inside so even if you don't go to the game, it's still a fun atmosphere to sit and watch the game on the TV. \n\nI wouldn't drive to Downtown Phoenix just to visit Marjeles, but this is definitely one of my choices when I'm looking for a sports bar before or after the game in Downtown Phoenix.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-11", "type": "review"}

The bread pudding was very good, but for me was a little heavy on the cinnamon.  I think I'll go with the Tiramisu next time.  Our water was pleasant and attentive.  The atmosphere was casual and cozy/romantic...  but I would rather see real candles on the tables vs the battery operated tea lights.", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-20", "type": "review"}

You must know what you are getting--I don't have to tell you the pizza, breadsticks, chicken strips, pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for.  However, this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations (less than a mile from my house), and although this location has been prompt and delicious, this is more a review about the man himself, Mr. Domino and my online ordering experiences with him.\n\nMy friends, why would you spend $17 on a Domino's pizza when Papa John's will give it to you for $11?.  Not to say I'm a broke hobo, but seriously, the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and 2 at the places I frequent.  My biggest irk with Domino's is that they advertise $11.99 Any Speciality Pizza and if you change 1 item, say you don't like mushrooms (not saying that's me, could be, not saying) and trade for something like black olives (even trade, no?  Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.\n\nPJ's.

First, the good:  This place is sooo clean, the guys are all awesome, polite, knowledgeable and you just get a great sense of being in a respectable place.   \n\nThe bad: One the way out the door, the mechanic that checked me in mentioned that it would be \"Fifty bucks to check out the car, and we'll call you with a quote.\"\n\nThe quote came in for almost $900, which was far more than I was able to pay.   When I got back to the shop to pick it up, I was charged $61.34. I questioned the difference between what I was told and what they charged me, and apparently it was $55 for the inspection, plus shop rags, plus tax.  I guess I should have seen this coming?   I have never been charged to look at the car.  And certainly not $62 for a ten minute inspection. \n\nI was in the market for a new mechanic, but this is NOT the one that I will be going with.  They were somewhat surprised that I would fuss at all about the $12 difference.  As if I should have expected a 30% markup from what they told me.  Not a great way to build a relationship.  If they had told me before they took my keys and information about the cost of the inspection, quite honestly, I would have taken my car somewhere else.\n\nBottom line:  I think that if you know you are going to get work done, these guys look really top notch. But be prepared to pay for it.\n\nUPDATE:   I just finished repairing the car myself, and what these guys wanted to charge me $900 for, I was able to do myself for $140.  And that included buying a $20 set of drum brake tools, and a $25 Chilton's manual.  They told me that it would $130 JUST to bleed the brakes, which I did in about ten minutes with nothing but a pair of channel locks.

(a whole other topic)\nIn response I want to better describe what I am referring to in my previous review.  Everything has always been neat and clean with Gaylord.  Their food has never had a bad or spoiled taste.  My illness has nothing to do with food poisoning or anything like that.  I have just felt nauseous for a while after eating their catered breakfasts.  I really think they need to change up their eggs, sausage and breakfast potatoes.

In fact, Gaylord has always been on time, the staff is neat and professional and everything is presented nicely.\n\nAnyone who is selecting a catering service should taste test a complete meal that is being served before ordering the service.   I have experienced some real nightmares at weddings, funerals and family reunions. Gaylord Catering has never presented a dish like some of the bad dishes I have been served over the years by other catering services.

Being a lover of all things dairy walking in, I beelined for the cheese counter, demanding samples of anything and everything.  Oh my!  Anything from a basic, kid friendly American to a 15 year aged Cheddar, to their own special haus cheese.  I probably walked out with a good 2 lbs of various cheeses (and am still wondering how those seemed to add 10 lbs to my figure, but that's another story).  In addition, there were the usual Wisconsin knick knacks, including many types of beers, wines, and other kitsch-y stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers.

I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \"I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\" template.\n \n Majerle's is one of those experiences.\n\nI know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.\n When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.\n \n   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. \n  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. \nNot so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.\nDownright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.\n If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-11-20", "type": "review"}

I have gone twice and have left extremely impressed both times.  The atmosphere is so amazing.  Right away, just walking through the courtyard to the main entrance, there's so much beauty to take in.  You'll walk past the courtyard cafe, cantina, bookstore, and gift shop on the way to the main entrance.  Both times I've gone, I did the museum first and then the shops and cafe afterwards.  \n\nThe entire museum is somewhat of a maze and, if you're not on a guided tour, can be pretty confusing to navigate.  We didn't have a tour guide either time -- they're free and on a regular schedule, but we preferred to wander at our own pace.  The first floor is very large and divided up into sections.  There's a lot of baskets, pottery, and katsina dolls to check out, and some really interesting native american history to take in.  I learned a lot about the local and native history.  The first floor (to me) gets boring kind of quickly.  A lot of the collections are not as old or historic as I had expected.  It seems like the younger visitors enjoyed the first level more than I did.\n\nThe most impressive part of the museum for me was the 2nd level.  I was in complete awe of the Indian Boarding School exhibit.  I learned SO much about the Indian Schools that I had never even heard of before.  I really wish they would have taught us about this experience when I was in school.  It was AMAZING.  \n\nOverall, the museum experience was very good.  We learned a lot and really enjoyed the history, art, and culture.  The only thing I don't like about the museum is navigating through it.  They do give you maps and offer guided tours, but it's fairly difficult to navigate if you don't know where you're going.  I don't like to look at maps, I prefer to wander.  Different areas are not very clearly marked.  You'll see a door in a hallway and wonder what it leads to, then walk through and realize you're entering a completely different part of the museum.  It's kind of hard to explain, but I wish the areas were more clearly marked.  It's not really big enough to get lost in, but we definitely had several occurrences where we weren't really sure where we were or where we were headed.\n\nThe 2nd time I visited, we decided to have lunch at the cafe and we were really impressed.  The service was great and the prices were MUCH more reasonable than we had expected.  We figured it would be pricey, but it was not.  I had the smoked salmon quesadilla and it was outstanding.  \n\nThe museum shop is pretty typical from what I've experienced at other museums -- a few knick-knacks that are in my price range, surrounded by ridiculously high priced pieces of art/pottery/dolls/rugs.  It's REALLY neat to look at but I couldn't imagine buying anything other than a magnet or a coffee mug.  Some of the pieces are thousands of dollars, but it's awesome to just look and admire.\n\nOverall, always a great experience, easy to find (there's a light rail stop right out front), and it's also very close to other touristy places if you're visiting and want to experience Phoenix.

I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places.\nThat being said, I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger.\n\nMy husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere. \n\nWe sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool. \n\nFor our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the \"true Thai foodie.\" With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good. \n\nI'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors.

When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry. \n\nI am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts.

The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce.

We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. \n\nOur dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw.

If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \n\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. \n\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \n\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. \n\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more).", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-06-29", "type": "review"}

Don't be fooled by their pictures on their site... those are the suites. \n\nPaper-thin walls: I can hear the guy in the next room over having a conference call... and I can fully understand what he's saying. Can also hear him farting in the bathroom. Not much privacy!\n\nIrregular water heat: Shower works well as long as no one else in the building is flushing a toilet. You'll be standing there and then all of a sudden it's scolding hot. Happened about once every 30 seconds. Water was also cold in the mornings since everyone else was showering as well.\n\nNo control over AC: I know it's Phoenix, but come on. My room was basically a refrigerator at all hours of the day, with no control over it. Vent actuator was broken.\n\n----\n\nOverall opinion: Not worth the money. For a few bucks more I could have stayed at the Hyatt or something. I know their selling point is the whole historical aspect, but c'mon guys; time for a renovation! Will probably not be staying here again the next time I'm in town.", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-10-21", "type": "review"}

I don't care if you don't like seafood, you will love this. You might think it's just sauce that the mussels are served in. It's soup. You will drink it, and you will wipe up every last drop with your fingers. There is nothing else like it. I'm serious. This is the stuff late-night cravings are made of. \n\nThe pad thai is good, but you can experiment here, ask the waitress for ideas, and know that you'll end up with something different and exciting. There are a few dishes that are acquired tastes (I'm learning to love wild boar), but because I eat here, I get to say \"I eat wild boar!\" and it makes me sound like a better person. And I'm pretty sure eating wild boar does make me a better person, at least to Lost groupies.\n\nMy main criticism is that they can sometimes hold back on the heat. It's not enough to say you want it hot. They'll assume you mean \"American hot.\" Make sure to specify \"Thai hot.\" The burn is good.\n\nYou must save room for dessert. This is essential. It will show you another side of Thai you may not have experienced before. I wouldn't go here just for desert, but drinks + dessert = win.\n\nThe inside is white tablecloths and candles. This is where you take a date, where the hostess will make sure you're happy and the waitresses will keep your glass always full. And you can see the kitchen from every table, so it feels like you're taking your date to a favorite neighborhood family restaurant (you are, and it is).  The only problem is the bar, which usually has a few sad people at it. I like to think it just adds to the neighborhood feel.\n\nThe patio is fun, with great seating arrangements, misters, and a vibrant atmosphere during the evening (don't sit here for lunch). It can be a little difficult to get service on the patio unless it's already packed. If you're with friends who want to hang out, choose the patio. It's great for spending the evening, with good drink service and lively conversation going on all around you.\n\nFinally, this is on a light rail stop, so there is absolutely no excuse not to make it part of your night out.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-20", "type": "review"}

We were told it would be about 20 minutes to seat our small group, and that was just fine. The bar was cozy, the beers fresh, and the service attentive, friendly, and helpful.\n\nSoon enough, our name was called and we were seated in one of the \"auxillary\" dining areas. Clearly an add-on, not a single decoration, but definitely welcomed; the place was packed and we were seated quickly, so it's all good by me.\n\nOur waitress took our orders and brought us a round of Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours. We gnoshed on the deliciously fresh rye bread, which was unlike any other rye I've had. It featured a very mild rye flavor and a very light texture. It was delicious.\n\nFish arrived within minutes: fried ocean perch and battered cod, one order of fries, and two orders of cheesy hashbrowns (cost an extra $2 per).\n\nThe fried ocean perch is all you can eat, and it's fresh, lightly breaded, flavorful, grease-free, and easily some of the best fish I've had at a fish fry. I scarfed down three heaping plates, and I do mean \"heaping.\" They're not skimpy with the refills.\n\nBattered cod was equally good, but it wasn't all you can eat. Three large, beautifully brown, battered and flaky filets are what you get.\n\nFries were outstanding as well; crinkle cut, fresh, hot, crispy. Yum. Hashbrowns were cooked perfectly but the slab of Velveeta that was slapped on top to make them \"cheesy\" was disappointing.\n\nService was the best yet. No complaints.

I saw they had Happy Hour deals so i went there a little early to have a drink in their bar or cantina except for they don't have one.  Bummer.  We had 7 people in our party and they don't take reservations so I put our name in ahead of time and just sat in the waiting area.  Another member of our party arrived too with the same thought I had to have a drink in the bar while waiting for the others to arrive.  The owner or manager was in the front at the hostess table and he was nice enough to let us go ahead and get seated while we waited for the rest of our party.  This was smart because my friend and I and ultimately a 3rd guest arrived and we had washed down 5 beers until the rest arrived.  You don't make money with people waiting to be seated.\n\nWe started off with appetizers of a couple of orders of cheese crisps and a side of guacamole.  wow were these good.  I totally recommend these to anybody for starters.  For dinner I ordered the Carne Asada Tampeque\u00f1a.  It was Carne Asada, a cheese enchilada, rice, beans, tortillas and a side garnish of lettuce, tomatoes and guacamole.  Great meal at a great price.  i could barely finish it.  I love horchata and noticed they had it on the menu so I ordered a glass of it and it came in HUGE cup served over ice.  Tastiest horchata I've had in a long time.  For dessert I heard the Churros & Ice Cream was to die for so I tried it.  Holy hell is that good and a great idea.  if I can't have my fried ice cream, this definately ranks right up there.  The churros were hot and crispy and along with the vanilla flavored ice cream I wanted with it, I will be definitely getting that again!\n\nI would give CG 5 stars but I have to take a star off for location.  It is in a dicey part of town but there were security guards watching the parking lot and parking when I left the restaurant at around 8 was a zoo so if you come in during prime dinner time you might have a hard time finding a spot.

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \n\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \n\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \n\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. \n\nDeli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker \"clean\" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \n\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \n\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a \"freegan\" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small \"mom & pop\" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both.

Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.  \n\n- It's pricey.  I recently bought 2 sea scallops, a pound of Halibut, and a 6-oz Tuna fillet.  Price: $50.86.  Ouch.\n\n- Limited selection of \"staple-goods.\"  Sure, I can get fresh Alaskan King Crab or a locally-made vegan cookie from the bakery at a moment's notice, but I dare you to find a box of Blueberry Special K on a Sunday night... I think they stock 4 or 5 of those, and when they're gone, they're gone (they're also about $1 higher than Woodman's).\n\n- It's inconvenient to get in and out of.  University Avenue S-U-C-K-S sucks.  And, if you wish to head west from Metcalfe's, you have to turn onto Midvale, make a U-turn, and then sit at the Midvale/University light and wait... The parking lot is also a cluster-F.\n\n- The checkers can be a bit snooty.  That, or I get the same girl every time... it really does seem as though I'm bothering the heck out of her by giving her a handful of items to scan, waiting on a total, and then giving her money.  I usually encounter a \"why-are-you-bothering-me-with-this\" sigh or a roll of the eyes at some point during checkout.  \n\n- The clientele can be a bit snobby (especially the ones that hop out of their leased BMWs).  Yeah, so you think you're cool in your BMW, but we both know that you're living in a rundown apartment, using one credit card to pay the other, and you're maybe 2-weeks from having the Bimmer repo'd.  Get over yourself... and flip your collar down and straighten that hat - you look ridiculous, fratty.  Ok?\n\n\nAnd now for the good stuff.\n\n+ The service workers (Deli, bakery, etc) are fantastic.  Very knowledgeable and helpful.  Makes it seem a little less painful when you're paying $28.99/lb for fish or buying a $4 cupcake.\n\n+ Fruits and Veggies are usually top notch quality.\n\n+ They place an emphasis on locally sourced products.\n\nSo there you have it.

And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. \nThe host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\"\nIt was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. \nI got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\"\nAll these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant?

She has an adult daughter who is mentally-challenged that is the root is all of her firings. Margie and two of her girlfriends (Dottie and Jean) discuss ways to help Margie after her recent dismissal from the Dollar Store.

Since they were supposed to close at 11:00 pm we figured it was enough time to eat. When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us. We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender. He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly.  \n\nThe only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there. She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep. 5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10:30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks. She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined. She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! \n\nOur food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us. I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11:00 pm on the dot! \n\nMy partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above. Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit. If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant. I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality. \n\nI will not be coming back. Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book.

Nice. \n\nMy saucy side dish(aka boyfriend) ordered the turkey, which we both thought was good...but nothing amazing. The sides were really tasty too.

Although not normally open on Sunday, they were willing to make arrangements with us so we could pick up the car.\n\nAt 10:15 AM, they called to let us know whe could pick up the car in 15 minutes.

I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)\n\nFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\n\nCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\n\nFood:  It's typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong.\n\nService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there.  Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along.  It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude.\n\nPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-20", "type": "review"}

But that's where the positive praise ends for me.\n\nWe visited here several times in search of our next doggie family member. Never were we greeted. Not even a mean greeting, or a rude greeting... No greeting. It seems anyone can just walk in here and roam around. That was always a red flag to me when I went there but we wanted to rescue a dog and give it a loving home, so we continued to go.\n\nFinally, we found a dog that didn't have \"adoption pending\" on it's kennel, since almost all do there ( maybe try keeping animals who are already adopted separate from available ones,DCHS?). We had to track down a staff member since none ever seem to be around even monitoring the dog kennels (another red flag). Finally we did and we asked to see the dog. Here's where it really got weird...\n\nThe two women, who never introduced themselves (I refer to them as the blonde and the brunette) seemed very adamant about us taking him that same evening. They hadn't asked us any interview questions like other shelters do... They never even asked us what type of home he'd be in or anything. they asked us if we had kids, if we lived alone, and if we owned our home. Apparently three questions answered and you can take home a dog? ( horrible). But we were so excited about the dog we weren't really thinking about their lack of questions or how pushy they seemed about us taking him right away.\n\nOnce we got home with him we learned why they were so pushy. They told us he was so sweet... Such a calm guy, loving etc. They said he got nervous in the kennel but that's it. We bring him home and within a few hours he is biting us, growling at us, and literally grabbed my subway sand which out of my hand the second I picked it up .. When I tried to say no and get my sandwich back he bit my hand and drew blood. Later he also stole the remote out of my boyfriends hand and tore it to pieces in a second. He growls everytime you go near him.. And this is while we are talking in calm quiet voices, moving slowly, trying to do anything to make him feel calmer.\n\nHe has now bitten us each multiple times in 12 hrs.. He knocks anything over (plants, anything on the counter) and growls at you and tries to bite if you run to pick it up.\n\nI'm not mad at the dog. It isn't his fault he probably was abused in previous homes. But- it was absolutely the DCHS job to tell us he was aggressive. To tell us he bites and snarls and growls. To tell us he may guard food even food that isn't his. Were furious that they completely lied to us and were so pushy about us taking him immediately (no wonder why though). Do NOT adopt a dog from here simply because these people have no business conducting behavioral assessments on dogs as they failed with this one... They also are illegally lying to people to get them to take home a dog. \n\nWe are furious and wanted this dog more than anything but we deserved to be properly prepared for the way he is so aggressive. We told them we wanted a calm family dog who was a sweetie and we go on runs with. They had him in the shelter for a month- if we learned his behaviors in a day, I'm sure they knew all about his biting and aggression. I've had many dogs all who were trained by me and I have never seen a dog with this level of aggression in my life. I'm severely disappointed in the DCHS.\n\nBottom line: do not misrepresent your animals. Do not lie to the consumer.

I love free stuff. Even if it appears to be absurd, like a Sunday paper. The deal is, you spend five dollars and they give you a two dollar Wisconsin Sunday paper. Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.\n\nIt is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.\n\nBack to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars? No.\n\nSorry Mr. and Mrs. Metcalfe (or whomever you are), work on the bakery, let me know and I will come back and re-evaluate you again.", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-21", "type": "review"}

Now that the rail is almost up and running and getting to Wild Thaiger isn't such a chore, I went with a group of 6 to try this place out.\n\nWhen you walk in you immediately notice how dark it is as the lighting given off by candles and the kitchen in the back.  I've been to plenty of restaurants that do this to set the mood of the place so I don't mind candlelight.  However, this place was almost pitch black at times to where I couldn't see my dish so they could improve on the lighting a little bit.  The booths are small and set up very nice if you're just out on a date with your special someone.\n\nThe menu selection isn't vast but has all the usual suspects (curries, noodles, tofu dishes, etc.).  I had the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggies on the side.  While the presentation was very nice, the dish itself was just okay.  Almost everyone in the group I was with also had a currie dish and agreed the presentation was more impressive than the taste itself.  The one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific.\n\nMost of us got dessert to finish things off.  I got a slice of the mango cheesecake (very tasty).  Another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy.  Everyone else got slices of the chocolate cake (which were HUGE by the way).\n\nThey also have drink specials on Monday and Wednesdays.  We went on Wednesday for $4 wine glass night.  I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine, but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it.  I has a Shiraz instead which was fine.  Most everyone else got a white wine.\n\nOverall, the service was a little bit slow (especially getting us our check), but it was adequate.  The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish (which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before).  Amazingly, when we originally sat down, the restaurant was just about dead.  But after 8:30pm the place was packed!  Not sure if this is normal, but seems like alot of the folks who live in and around the downtown area needed a late Thai fix.\n\nBottomline, good, but I've had better.  I commend Wild Thaiger and their people for surviving the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt crippled their business.  Based on what we've seen, this place had a pretty solid local following so clearly they've done something right.  This place is okay if you're looking to go out with a group, but I'd probably enjoy this place more if it was just me and my girlfriend.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-08-07", "type": "review"}

Flash forward to an hour before my much anticipated appointment I received a voicemail message informing me that Mallory was running behind with another appointment and I would need to call to reschedule mine.  WTF? You're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter service?\n\nI swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment, they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience.  Nope.  I was informed that Mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or I could see someone else on a Tuesday - Who needs their makeup done for a Tuesday night?\n\nHonestly if it wasn't a gift certificate I would just cancel and go somewhere else. This is NOT a great first impression.\n\nTo be fair, I would like to add that their phone staff have always been delightful. So that and the limitations of yelp are the only reason they get a star.  I will update after I have my service, hopefully they are worth the inconvenience and irritation.", "business_id": "WfeA7PurZdBOPXcGB27vEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-13", "type": "review"}

The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).

Luxury is stretch limousines. Luxury is diamond tiaras and Rolex watches. Luxury is Bentleys and Beverly Hills; bone-in filets and \"bon appetite\". Luxury is throwing some glitter and making it rain.\n\nI once thought luxury in its truest form was to only be attainable by the rich and the powerful - but boy was I wrong. People -- luxury IS attainable. I know this, because I recently experienced it at the Country Inn and Suites outside of Madison, WI. \n\n Whether you opt for an \"inn\" or spring for a \"suite\" - you're going to love this fucking hotel. Upon entering the palatial lobby, a charming bellman presented me with my own personal luggage dolly, even though it was clear that my strapping, young body was more than adequate to carry my small, nylon duffle bag. The Sconnie at the front desk even put me up on the top floor of the resort (floor 3), which offered views of one of the most gorgeous bodies of water I had ever seen. \n\nThe ice bucket was a nice touch. It was large, though not too large as to take up much of the expansive counter space the room provided. There was even a plastic liner for the bucket--which I scoffed at. To think, who would even consider using it in such a pristine, meticulously manicured suite? I quickly tossed it, and when I did I couldn't help but notice the luxurious mini-fridge down below. Let me tell you, there was nothing \"mini\" about this fridge. I fit an entire case of Coors Light in there, along with some Gatorade, and cheese curds to boot. It looked so cool and cozy that, at the end of the evening, I wanted to curl up and sleep in there.\n\nThough it wasn't easy -- I refrained from sleeping in the mini-fridge. I mean, how could I sleep in there with one of the most luxurious beds I had ever seen staring me in the face? You could fit John, Kate, and the 8 on this bed. I never would, though. I'd kick them all out and keep all of the fresh pillows and down comforters to myself-- because THAT'S luxury, and Kate is mean. If it wasn't for a call of nature which I battled until my bladder nearly exploded on all of the luxurious bedding, I might STILL be laying in that fluffy wonderland of extravagance. \n\nNow, I've peed in some nice bathrooms... very nice bathrooms actually. Once, I came across a bathroom SO nice, I couldn't pee in there. I held it, and peed in my less fortunate bathroom at home-- but this bathroom? This bathroom was so luxurious; I HAD to pee in it. I couldn't unzip my fly fast enough (literally, I peed a little in my pants). Thankfully there was a cornucopia of fine soaps and lotions at my disposal. I would bet that royalty uses these same soaps - they just had that royal smell about them. When I was done drying my hands, I squirted a little more of that soap on them and didn't even wash it off.\n\nSummary: In hindsight, this is really only a place you want to stay at if you're celebrating something really special-- a honeymoon, for instance, or a significant wedding anniversary. I would've stayed someplace else had I known the Country Inn and Suites was so luxurious. Now, back at my home, I fear I may never taste that royal tang again. Enjoy your stay here; cherish it.

At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \n\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\n\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.

I have seen her through thick and thin, joys and sadnesses, 2 breast lump scares, abnormal papsmears, etc.  No matter what troubles and health concerns God presented me with, Dr. Johnstone was there to calm me, lend an ear to any and all of my concerns, and to move forward with appropriate treatments.\n\nI was overjoyed last May to learn that my husband and I were expecting our first child.  I could not wait to go to Dr. Johnstone's office to tell her the news & talk with her about the prenatal care that was to come.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that it's a 45 minute to a 1 hour drive to Dr. Johnstone's office, my husband asked if I could please find a doctor closer to our home in North Scottsdale to go to for the prenatal care as he did not see any sense in driving so far south to frequent appointments when there were perfectly capable doctors much closer to home.\n\nHesitantly, I agreed to switch doctors.  I asked my primary care physician at Mayo Clinic Thunderbird who she would recommend and she gave me the name of an OBGYN only about 15 minutes from my home.  My husband and I visited them for several appointments.  The doctor and the office staff were courteous and nice.  They seemed to know what they were doing/talking about.  However, this doctor WAS NOT Dr. Johnstone.  I missed her, her patience with my questions, her terrific way of explaining things to me in a way I could understand, etc.  \n\nAfter I cried and cried to my husband to PLEASE let me switch back, I returned to Dr. Johnstone late in my 2nd trimester for the remainder of my pregnancy.  My baby is due Feb 7th 2013 & I couldn't be happier I made this decision.  I could not imagine anyone other than doctor Johnstone delivering this baby.  \n\nI have read the reviews others have posted regarding not being pleased with the front desk/office staff.  I have not had that experience.  They are running a business and sometimes they are very busy and down to business, but I find that if you greet them with a positive attitude, a smile, and your respect, they will be equally respectful to you.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Johnstone and her practice to anyone.  It is true sometimes they run behind and you need to wait to be taken back for your appointment a little late.  I am not put off by this as I worked for Social Security for approximately 8 years and I understand what it's like to fall behind when giving your full time and attention to each individual as they deserve.  Also, I would imagine it would be reasonable to think some patients may be a little late for their appointments causing the whole office to fall a little bit behind.  It does not turn me off at all, and I will gladly continue driving the distance for this high quality of care (& genuine caring) in the future.", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-30", "type": "review"}

So yesterday I braved the Metro from Mesa and went to the Heard Museum, and I'm glad I did.  It is a beautiful facility and the exhibits are well-done with lots of explanations and information.\n\nTwo or three gripes:  first, the docents (female) who were giving tours on Monday, 2/25/13, couldn't speak loud enough for the group to hear.  They need to provide some sort of microphone system for the docents to speak to their tours; they are available.  The first docent who, I discovered later, is new and still in training, had a problem with her speed.  She would start explaining about a particular room or exhibit before the entire group was within hearing distance--and about the time the last people came near enough to hear her, she was off to the next exhibit.  \n\nPhotography is allowed in the museum; however, some of the exhibits and explanatory walls are covered with a reflective glass or plex which reflects the light from behind, making photography difficult.\n\nThe prices in the sit-down restaurant are very very very expensive - They are quite appropriate for a dinner, but for a lunch at a venue which is pricey to enter in the first place, an overpriced sandwich isn't appropriate.  Even the hot dog combo in the cantina was $7!  Why does every facility of this type add to the cost of the enjoyment of the place by offering overpriced food?\n\nThe building and grounds are gorgeous, and quite an oasis in the middle of a busy city.  Getting there is a breeze on the Metro, with the stop just across the street.  \n\nI enjoyed my day at Heard, but I probably won't be back.  An attraction like this is usually a one-time thing for me.", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-26", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\n\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\n\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\n\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\n\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \"standard-from-the-bag\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\n\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \n\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \n\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\n\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \n\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \n\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\n\nStamm House = FAIL\n\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\nService: 4.5 stars \nValue: 3 stars\n\n\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-20", "type": "review"}

The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.\n\nWe started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.\n\n I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.\n\nAll in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips. I may go back for drinks but will think twice, and probably even three times before I eat there again.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-26", "type": "review"}

I could hear snoring from one room, coughing from across the hall and the TV on the other side....just awful.\n\nThe staff wasn't very helpful---forgot to program a wake up call, refused to assist when an alarm had been going off in another room for over an hour in the middle of the afternoon, etc. \n\nThe ghost lounge was very cute...I went down and it was a swing night which seemed to be fun. \n\nI'd be willing to come back to the lounge, but not the hotel for sure.", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-18", "type": "review"}

I usually go workout with my trainer (Jesse) around 530 and we always are able to workout with no waiting for having to share machines.  They have a lane pool, jacuzzi and sauna rooms.  It kind of reminds me of the YMCA downtown Tucson.  The only problem that I have with the place is the smell in the men's locker room.
