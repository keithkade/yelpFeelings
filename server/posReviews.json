Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along.  You end up with edible but uninspired eats.  Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care.  My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny.  The four (!) large slices of bacon were thick and flavorful.  I ordered the hash-browns crispy, and that's how they came.  Everything on the plate was cooked just right and tasted super good.  I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this.\n\nService was fast and friendly.  Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful.  The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested.  Prices were as cheap as the day is long.

Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  \n\nThe bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  \n\nFor the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. \n\nCraig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  \n\nMy fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.

I've got three corgis and after a co-worker referred me here in 2009, I'll never go anywhere else. Every vet my dogs have seen is wonderful...between the three pups I've met with three of the doctors. They're all sincere, empathetic, thorough, understanding, engaging, respectful, and love to share their knowledge. Dr. Haroldson is a sweetheart and can probably put any nervous pet-parent at ease. Dr. Erickson is calm and laid-back, and I can talk to him about even the most awkward pet problems. Dr. Schweitzer is lively--a total hoot. Anyone who likes The Walking Dead AND Downton Abbey is alright in my book!\n\nAll Pets has been able to see me with very short notice, has never rushed me in and out the door, and always made me feel like my dogs were their top priority, even on busier days. They communicate clearly about diagnostic and treatment options. Their prices are very reasonable, and they try less expensive solutions first, instead of immediately recommending the most costly. Not that I'm cheap, it's just that having three dogs adds up. When they weren't 100% positive about something, they aren't afraid to ask each other for second opinions, which I appreciated when my dog Harry swallowed a corncob and had to have emergency surgery.\n\nThat's another thing I love about this place, is that they remember all my dogs names when I walk in the door. Not only the vets, but the front desk staff. Maybe it's my fiction-writer's imagination, but they really make me feel like a VIP. Kenna is always so excited to greet my pups and I love hearing about hers. Dana has a killer sense of humor and if you're lucky, she'll grace you with one of her zingers.

Save yourselves a few minutes on cleaning that, I'm probably going to put new trash and crumbs in it shortly anyway. \n\nThey looked at me, and told me that they appreciated my sentiment and apologize for the wait, but they would feel bad about giving me a crumby car.

The best part is that is completely non-smoking, so there are no smoke odors in the rooms. \n\n With a complimentary shuttle, to the surrounding areas, you can't go wrong. I wanted to pay but it was WELL WORTH. I have no problem paying the rate again. The staff was awesome and more than welcoming. The bed, after an hour of drinking, was INCREDIBLE! Do not hesitate to stop here whether you're travelling or just need a weekend convenience! Thank u", "business_id": "i9JeI7bd1qXGi15FoD45GA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-24", "type": "review"}

I used to go with my parents as a kid, and now as an adult I've started to rediscover how much I loved their food.\n\nNestled in the eclectic Atwood Ave neighborhood, Monty's presents a 50's style diner with yummy lunch specials like meatloaf (very good meatloaf), sandwiches, and a wicked good brunch.  They also have ridiculously delicious chocolate shakes, so don't be afraid to splurge while you're there.  \n\nOne of the other great things about Monty's is the atmosphere; the area around it is filled with little mom and pop shops, the Barrymore theater, and relics of an older time.  Take a stroll around if it's a nice day and your bound to find something you like.  If not, I'm sure you probably enjoyed the food as all the dishes I've ever had were great and the portions were generous.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks though that held me back from giving a 5 star review.  First, there is usually a very long wait.  The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience.  Secondly, the service is hit or miss.  I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something.  Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing.\n\nSetting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed.  The food is so good you'll be stuffed in a recliner when you get home pining for more.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-13", "type": "review"}

What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.\n\nMy friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.\n\nThe negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  \n\nIf it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern.", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-24", "type": "review"}

I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.", "business_id": "_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-01", "type": "review"}

It really felt like we were staying at a friend's house, except I didn't need to help with the dishes.\n\nSome things that didn't bother me but might other people:\n1)  Note that they have two large dogs\n2)  If you're averse to flowered wallpaper, this is not the place for you.", "business_id": "XrzTVrJAjs0yYLvhFI9vkQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-06", "type": "review"}

So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to Madison.\n\nThe highlights:\n- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. \n- Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.\n- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. \n- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. \n\nIf you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage.", "business_id": "XrzTVrJAjs0yYLvhFI9vkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-19", "type": "review"}

There was an assortment of soaps, shampoos, bubble baths etc in the bathroom too.  The room and bathroom were clean and spotless.  Craig was extremely nice, helpful, and whipped up a killer breakfast.... a brown sugary, apple, cranberry, upside down baked french toast kind of concoction, homemade pumpkin bread, fresh watermelon, and sausage links.  He was very accomodating and asked us the night before if there were any allergies or food issues that he needed to know about.

We were going up to Madison for the day and found this place through a quick Google search of Madison-area B&B's.  Craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability.  He was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (I'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free, whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love.  When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.  Next time we are in the Madison area, we will definitely stay here.  Craig, thanks for all the hospitality!

I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). \n\nAnyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. \n\nI gave it a shot and I was impressed! \n\nFirst, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. \n\nThe fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. \n\nThe slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. \n\nTarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. \n\nThe bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. \n\nEverything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.\n\nThe service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.\n\nA little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. \n\nIt's worth it though and I'll be back.", "business_id": "HxPpZSY6Q1eARuiahhra6A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-02", "type": "review"}

Hands down, it's the best Chinese I've found so far.  I'd give it 5 stars if the prices were more reasonable and the dine-in environment was better.\n\nLike I said, the food is superb.  My usual dish is Cashew Chicken.  It's hard to deviate from that when it's sooooo good.  Other dishes are excellent as well.  What I like about Imperial is that the meat quality is good.  The beef is tasty and tender - not tough or \"questionable\".  The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments.  \n\nWe don't dine in often or at all.  It's a little more formal than I prefer, and the experience can take a while.  Just not my preference.  I keep their number in my phone and call ahead for carry-out.  That's the way to go here, imho.\n\nTheir location is very convenient for those of us that work in town and live in the western 'burbs.  The portions they give out are very fair - my cashew chicken typically leaves me with a nice lunch for work the next day. \n\nIf you're looking for top-quality Chinese food, I highly recommend getting take-out here.

I have never come away unimpressed with either the food or the service.  I can't really speak to authenticity since I wouldn't really know it if I saw it, but for what they do Mi Cocina does it well.  All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems.  The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre.  If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.\n\nLast time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.  The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal.  Mi Cocina probably won't ever be held up as a paragon of the style, but it has always been reliable and enjoyable and for that I'll keep coming back.", "business_id": "77ESrCo7hQ96VpCWWdvoxg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-16", "type": "review"}

The waiter brought us chips and salsa immediately, and then took our drink orders.  Within a few minutes, our sodas arrived, along with a cheese dip.\n\nWe quickly scarfed down the salsa and cheese dip; the salsa was initially mild but then had a nice little kick to it at the end.  The chips were a thicker cut chip; they weren't the slightest bit greasy.  The queso was excellent - nice and hearty, white cheese, delicious.\n\nWe ordered our entrees and within minutes our food was available.  There was a slight mix-up with my order - I had requested chicken burritos but received beef.  No big deal; the beef burritos were decent - some chunks of potato were an interesting touch.\n\nMy dining partner ordered a sampler plate, which came with a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a tamale.  It was good as well; the chicken was far better than the ground beef.\n\nService was beyond excellent - very fast, very attentive, and as such, we left a nice tip.  Only complaints?

He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  \n\nMy husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.

The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?

Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.

This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \n\nThe manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \n\nThere are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \n\nI noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\n\nI also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \n\nThere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food \"to-go\"  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.\n\nJan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \n\nMy final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.\n\nUntil my next stay...", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-04", "type": "review"}

Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large, well filled egg roll - also tasty, mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to). All lunch specials include roast pork fried rice which was good enough to buy on its own. Seems like a mom/pop place so support your local Chinese joint - down with PF/PW/PE.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wl-7A4jC0f27MOEmW-XTbQ"}

I assumed I would have to wait a long time for my food and it would be just okay. I was pleasantly surprised. Our food came relatively quickly, and my husband and I both enjoyed our sandwiches.  I had a CBLT which was excellent. The bread was perfect, and I loved fresh ingredients and the special mayo. My husband really liked the special of the day, which was  a tuna melt.  My bean and corn side salad was very fresh tasting, but could have used a tad more flavor. We also had a key lime coconut cookie that was AMAZING. I might have to go back next week just to get another one!!  The servers weren't overly friendly, but they definitely weren't UN-friendly. My only true \"complaint\" is that it is a bit pricy for what you get - it was almost $30 for our lunch of two sandwiches, two drinks, a cookie and a kid's meal- at least the kid's meal included the drink!  I will definitely be back to the Prairie Cafe! Don't let the other negative reviews scare you away! The sandwiches are definitely worth it! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

Dim sum and house made noodles, are just a couple of the new items people will be seeing on the menu.

There are spicy red curries, there are vietnamese spring rolls, sesame, Pad Thai, and their popular crab puffs.   A great refreshing drink to sample is The Sake Mojito.  Sake replaces the rum and soda water. Wow!! \n\nAs for value and quality, I don't feel that the food meets the high expectation generated by the price, as most seem to agree with.\n\nCons: No happy hour, average cocktail is $12\nPros: offers a late night menu, up to 3a on the weekends. lots of vegetarian items on the menu, great late night atmosphere", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-12", "type": "review"}

The servers are down-to-earth, the food is great, and best of all, it's open late! The lack of late-night joints in this city is horribly depressing.\n\nIt's sad to read other reviews of Fate being such an awful place. True, they do take reservations which can cause some trouble with people who just walk in. Those of you who complain about having to wait outside, look at what you are dining in - a house! It's not the most spacious restaurant and if it is busy, they certainly do not have room for people to crowd the place. If there is a long wait, again - a house! There are no more than a few tables. \n\nAs far as the service goes, it is excellent. The servers are extremely down-to-earth and knowledgable. The food is great, too - I recommend the Fried Tofu Wedges (well, the tofu in general), the Pad Thai, and the Hot and Sour soup. They also have fried rice, which is awesome with shrimp. \n\nAll in all Fate is a great place. Make reservations, grab a couple close friends, check out their awesome beer list, and you're guaranteed to have a great experience.", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-08", "type": "review"}

I think Fate has the best fried tofu I have ever had. \n\nIf you don't want to wait, be sure to make a reservation and it's generally speaking a more enjoyable atmosphere for smaller parties (ie, one or two people with you) rather than a large group.

It was a great large area that opened up to a balcony patio which was nice for the smokers. I had heard a lot about the lobster bisque and was eager to try it, I got that paired with the BLT. I must say they had quite an impressive menu with tons of options and special combos for lunch. My lobster bisque soup was fantastic, slightly spicy with large chunks of lobster. As I looked around the table I noticed humongous salads and burgers and everyone seemed pretty please with their food. The service was great, quick to check on us and refill drinks. They also gave us separate checks without being asked. \n\nAfter we ate, we ventured back downstairs to the patio and had a few cocktails. Our server was pretty slow, but I had ordered at the bar so I just got to tease everyone else.

First I must say I was highly impressed by the layout of this corner restaurant located in the downtown district of phoenix. \n\nMy visit was during the modest hours of 12pm, so I was greeted by the afternoon crowed. Taken to the upstairs portion of the resturante, this must have been some type of VIP room, decked out with couches, plasma televisions, private bar, and outside patio. This is a great location to hold a private event I thought to myself. \n\nThe prices on the menu were between 12-30 dollars(approx).  The food came quick was was large portions. I had the BBQ Chicken Pizza which was so fulfilling I hate to take half of it home. Very good service. \n\nMy one complaint would be that I didn't hear any music while upstairs, tho they had speakers, and I wish they would have been more intentive to ask my group if we wanted the televisions on.

Bourbon Steak Wrap ordered a side of Lobster Bisque.  I went for the daily special Fried chicken over potatoes.\n\nFood came pretty quickly.  I'll get the Fried Chicken special out of the way right now.  It was fried chicken, but it was NOT special.  It was better than KFC but that's about it.  the potatoes were barely warm.  the gravy was forgettable.  bad choice on my part when Mrs White's is barely three blocks away, but come on guys, at least wave the food over the heat a little bit.\n\nMy dining companions both raved about their choices.  Tequila Lime \nChicken was reported as \"very tasty\".  He ate half and boxed up the rest for the trip home.  Bourbon Steak Wrap was described as \"a little too sweet\" but all in all enjoyable, also boxed up and taken home.   Lobster Bisque was reported to be lip smackin good, though I tried it once and thought it was a little Campbell's-esque.\n\nThis is a nice place, dark, lots of sports on TV, It fills a niche in this neighborhood that Cooperstown deserted long ago and Friday's Front Row never occupied... that is, decent pub fare for pregame/postgame.

They are obviously frozen, and their sauce come to find out isn't even made in-house, but whatever, I'm here for football and beer.\n\nAs for those two things, C&W's is ace.  They have plenty of screens and lots of positions around the bar for viewing multiple games.  Every time I asked the manager to switch to the Titans game, he always obliged, even asking where i preferred to sit so he could change the appropriate TV.  Very nice touch.\n\nThe beers are large and VERY cheap ... $2.50 for a 20oz (i think 20oz) Bud Light and they have some other interesting beer choices if you want more.

It was a good choice, I think.  I didn't care for the outside which has loud music playing but inside it's a nice pub (upscale is a bit of a stretch...) with lots of TVs tuned to sports.

They made some futile attempts to get a \"Let's Go Dbacks\" chant going but the crowd wasn't that into it.  (And at that point there weren't that many Cubs fans there...)  They had a good healthy banter with the Cubs fans which was amusing.   They didn't care when we ordered shots of Jager, although the two female Cubs fans next to us were shocked.  (Sorry, this is just how we roll.  We don't take shots of whatever that nuts and berries concoction that you're drinking is....)  \n\nThe nachos were strange.

I believe that they have lunch specials every week day.\nHowever , they do charge extra for the little things. Like making it extra spicy is like .35 extra and brown rice is a little extra, I mean barley enough to where you would even notice.\n\nThey have soup, and sushi, salad,etc.\nLots of nice cool drinks. If the weather is cooler(below 90) you can sit outside and enjoy the light rail going by.\nWhich also means that you can take the light rail here as well.\nIt is located in the same spot as always, right next to the Phoenix, Public Library.\nWhen in downtown Phoenix, give it a try.", "business_id": "kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-27", "type": "review"}

And glad we were! \n\nWe had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!\n\nI picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window.

She was a fantastic host.  \n\nEveryone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.\n\nAll in all, a great experience.

Unlike most places, it seems like they cook the chicken in the sauce so that it's coated with the teriyaki flavor, rather tossing the chicken with the sauce or pouring sauce on top before serving it. That makes it a little more dry than I'm used to, but it also gives it a nice smokiness.

This isn't like hot sauce over a dish, this is the real deal.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it definitely hits the spot and is always sure to please. My usual tends to be the chicken curry. They really know how to pack in the flavor and make a portion that's not too big and not too small. My only complaint is that they tend to go a bit over on the onions. Another thing to pick up while you're there is their Japanese soda. I forget the name of it, but it comes in a glass bottle and it has a glass ball that rolls around inside. It's refreshing and fun to drink as well. The sushi here is kinda \"eh\", but it fills you up and chances are that if you're eating there you're not looking for top quality sushi.\n\nMy impression of the place is that it's family owned by the women that work there. The older one is really friendly and makes sure that you're enjoying your meal after she serves it to you. You can tell that they really appreciate your patronage and want you to come back. It's always a good thing to know that the owners of a restaurant are passionate and take pride in what they do and treat it as more than just a job.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been here, but I really need to swing by again. Some people would probably just brush this place off as some small food hut on a street corner. That would be a huge mistake. This place is like the Yoda of Phoenician restaurants in that it reminds you that, \"Size matters not.\"", "business_id": "kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-27", "type": "review"}

But there's only one thing I order each time I come here, Nachos! This place has the most delicious plate of nachos that I've come across in the area. Of course the serving size is generous, I usually make it a point to not finish the plate, it's so big. It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips. The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that doesn't hit a spot, but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind!

They are on double corn tortillas which is a bit much for me, I can never eat more than two (which is why the three taco minimum kind of sucks, but who can beat $3 for lunch with leftovers?).  The steak tacos are nothing compared to the chicken, the steak just isn't very flavorful, I definitely would not recommend them.  I have never tried the beef, which come on a crisp taco shell.

It is clearly several steps up from your local generic Mexican drive through, but it's still just not tasty.\n\nThis fact does not dissuade me from visiting Chico's on a semi-kinda-regular basis - it is close to my work, and the wait is generally minimal.  Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical \"lunch rush\" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.\n\nA quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called. \n\nIf you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.\n\nI have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican \"grilled\" platter, or the entree includes \"grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual \"crunch\"? This is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in. Doused in copious amount of salsa, it's not too bad, but I can't imagine straight-up muching on it without that extra step of preparation.\n\nThe rice is good. I can't comment on the beans, because I don't eat them!\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is cute - much nicer than your usual chain, reflete with wooden parrots and brightly-colored tiles.

You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!\n\nAnyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.\n\nOh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips.\n\nOn top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes.

The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we?

He has no problem with Surlys, he said, and he'd build me one if that's what I wanted. But he made me do some research first. And he asked me what I'd be using the bike for. Earl and I talked for about an hour that day, and I left the shop with a few of Earl's suggestions: bikes and companies I had never heard of or considered (Handsome Cycles, Soma, All-City, to name a few). \n\nI still wanted that Surly, though, so I went back. \"Build me a Surly!\" Earl said he would. But I'm short (barely five-foot-two), so Earl wanted to make sure I'd actually fit on a Surly before ordering one. He called a previous customer and asked her to bring in her Surly. He hooked the bike up to the trainer, watched me pedal, told me to shift, told me to break, told me to actually ride the bike, and I did. So, he ordered me the surly. \n\nThe whole process - sitting down, ordering the bike (the Cross-Check), picking the color (wonderful lime green), selecting the seat and pedals and fenders and, and, and - took about twenty minutes. The building of the bike took exactly a week. And it's a beautiful bike. Sleek and clean and fast and light. Put together expertly. Adjusted at least three times (Can you raise the seat? Can you lower the seat? Can you pull the handlebars forward? Can you pull the seat forward?) the day I picked it up. Happily. \n\nIt was a dream, building this bike with Revolution. Not once did I feel pressured by Earl or the rest of the crew at Revolution. Not once did I feel belittled, talked down to, or laughed at. Not once did I feel that my dream bike wasn't cool enough, worthy enough, or good enough to build. I had a bike in mind, and Earl told me to think about it. I thought about it, and Earl told me they could do it. And they did. Professionally, quickly, expertly. And I could not be happier with the bike I've got now. \n\nI'll come back again and again and again to these guys because they're just that good. For everything. Fixing up old bikes, like my Specialized, and building new ones. The best.", "business_id": "QMWdcByvCYCrs7-IQyr26w", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-23", "type": "review"}

So you can just imagine how tense all things were.  The staff was really friendly and understanding of hundreds of law grads flooding their venue.  \n\nThe Falling Water restaurant is a convenient locale and located in the lobby.  If I had no vehicle, I would eat there and be okay with it.  I ordered a sandwich for lunch and it was a bit \"buttery.\"  I do like that you can order your food ahead of time and have it ready at a particular time.  \n\nThe rooms are very typical.  Nothing outstanding, but it is nice to have a window to look at something besides a brick wall.  You get a parking lot view but you get motion.  \n\nThe banquet rooms were gorgeous.  The hotel is nicely decorated.  It even has a small waterfall hiding the elevators.  I was annoyed by the parking situation.  It is downhill.  Not a huge hill, but enough to make the walk precarious during these icy times.  Perhaps a little more salt could be expended for visitors.  The location is nice as it is near restaurant and a mall.  Forget something at home?  There is even a costco within ten minutes driving.  It is about 1/4 mile off the beltline and just outside of Madison (by one highway exit).  \n\nIf you want to stay in Madison but avoid the high prices of downtown and the congestion of rush hour, this is the place to be.", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-27", "type": "review"}

The place is T-I-N-Y tiny, but that's not a bad thing.  There are a handful of tables around the outside of the bar, and about 25-30 seats at the actual bar itself.  A low ceiling lends to the really smallish feel of the place.\n\nGreat jukebox, great service, good value.  We really enjoyed hanging out at the Villa Tap.  \n\nDrinks: we tried the whiskey old fashioned sour.  Lost points for not being muddled and for not using Squirt.  It was decent, regardless, and a great value; three old fashioneds came in at under $10.\n\nFood-wise - mixed results.  The appetizers (onion rings and cheese curds) were excellent.  Some of the best we've ever had, even if the curds were \"out of the box\" curds.  They were cooked perfectly, didn't show any signs of grease, and were absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe fish - we had deep fried cod all around - left much to be desired.  It was cooked better than any other fish we've ever had - it was so perfectly prepared... the batter was light and crispy; it was served piping hot; no signs of grease - it had all of the makings of a great fish fry.\n\nBut it was too fishy tasting; not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Cod shouldn't have a strong fish flavor.  Save that for bad Ocean Perch or Smelt... and that's what this cod tasted like.  :-(  So, despite being prepared to perfection, it failed to deliver on taste.\n\nThe fries were perfect, which is such a shame.  The Villa knows how to fry a mean dish - just wish the fish wasn't so \"off\" tasting.  We'll give them another shot, though.  I'm sure the burgers and other offerings are going to be good - The Villa was spot-on with everything else, so the fish may have been a fluke.\n\nVilla Tap = No Win/No Fail - it's a tie\n\nService = 4 stars (fast, prompt, spot-on)\nFood = 2.5 stars (fish = fail; all others = win)\nValue = 4 stars ($40 for 3 people with appetizers and fish)\nMisc = 4 stars (atmosphere, homey feel)\n\nDefinitely a great little bar; we'll give the fish another shot at some point and we'll certainly try the rest of the menu items!", "business_id": "J2AiPQnKWBxBwc4MMkbH8w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-10", "type": "review"}

When I was a kid I remember coming to many a Muskies game with my parents, but the crowds were always thin and no one was surprised when the Muskies and the subsequent teams folded.  Now Warner Park is a family destination as well as a popular party location.  For the last several years my company has held our summer outing here, tailgating in the parking lot before catching the game.  There always seems to be a huge crowd on the weekends.  \n\nThe Mallards organization provides an atmosphere that was missing when I was a kid.  Personally I love the game of baseball, with all of the intricacies of the pacing being a big part of the charm.  However, I realize that I'm in the minority here, because most of my friends find it kind of boring.  But the Mallards have really energized the park with the give-aways, the mascots, and all the other sideshows to the game.  My opinion is that if you want to see baseball played in all of it's old fashioned glory, go to Wrigley.  \n\nThe Duck Blind is the place to be for most of the adults that didn't bring children to the game.  For $25-35 it is all you can eat and drink in a sectioned-off area in the right field corner.  The food is pretty decent but the real attraction is the beer.  Led by local brewpub Great Dane's signature Mallards Ale, there is an excellent selection of beer.  This is undoubtedly why a lot of people attend, but it leads to a very festive atmosphere that is always a good time.  The only people not enjoying the Duck Blind are usually the opposing team's relief pitchers, since their bullpen is in the right field corner as well.  You can also win free tickets to the Duck Blind from US Cellular on the day of the game.  \n\nOutside of the Duck Blind, the park is very kid-friendly, with various mascots running around and all sorts of things to keep the kids occupied.  The main mascot rides a zipline down from the party deck in the Duck Blind to home plate to start off the game and set the tone.  It's always about having a good time.  The various promotions include \"B-List Celebrity Fridays,\" various throwback nights and bands playing live music.  The concessions range from the traditional hot dogs, peanut and cotton candy to the truly excellent jambalaya.  The prices are quite reasonable and the people working are always friendly and appear to be having as much of a good time as the fans.

I am new to Madison and everyone can't stop talking about what an experience it is to shop here. It's the fine-dining of grocery shopping. Well, I have only been shopping like a grown up for about a year now - but I learned how to do it in Denver. So the bar was set pretty high through Whole Foods and Safeway. But I can safely say that my experience at Metcalfe's topped it.\n\nIt was very clean and well stocked. I believe I went on a Friday night too. The main goal was to get some fresh meat and milk; let's face it - those are two items you don't want to get from an Aldi's or a Woodman's. I was told by a friend that I was lucky to live so close to it, but to be careful because it was expensive. WRONG, not expensive (or maybe Denver was expensive, so that word has become relative).\n\nSafeway had a discount meat section because it was within a few days of expiring (cook it that night and you're fine). Now, I wasn't looking for that at Metcalfe's (I don't know if they'd have that even), but I found $2 Pork Butt Steak (which, the mere name of the steak made me question it - but for $2 I'll try anything once). Delicious, and I won't go as far as to say I'm a great cook.\n\nOf course I also got some stuffed pork chops and fresh produce. But the experience I had was very pleasant and the prices were fair for the quality of food I was buying (dare I say, I thought prices should be higher).\n\nAs for the atmosphere, I don't think I've gone to a store in a long time that played classical music. I almost feel like if I came in sweatpants and a t-shirt that I would be under-dressed to get groceries.\n\nWhole Foods ain't got nothing on Metcalfe's (leave my double negative alone).", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-15", "type": "review"}

Well cancel your flight to NYC for the Smithsonian because believe it or not, we have some cultural options right here in the desert's playground. \n\nI went to the Heard Museum many a day when I was a little girl visiting Phoenix (a much less populated city at the time). From the crafts to the history, the Heard Museum entertained even an 8 year old who really just wanted to play in the pool all day long. Fast forward a \"couple\" of years and I decided it was time to give this historical haven the grownup test. My friends, I was more than impressed. You know how sometimes you visit someplace as a kid and then you go back as an adult and everything seems smaller and just cheaper looking? Don't worry about this being the case with the Heard Museum. They have done a fabulous job of keeping the museum up-to-date, clean and full of great ways for all ages to learn about the Native American culture in Arizona. \n\nSome highlights include:\n\n1. Interactive. The Heard created great displays with information and an interactive game for children...or children at heart. \n\n2. Visual dessert for the eyes. They don't cheat you on historical artifact exhibits which shows that they have a nice group of donors who are eager to keep the museum alive and visually stimulating. \n\n3. Family-fun for everyone. I saw a brochure marketing family-fun days every Saturday in July. Activities include, interactive games, crafts, live performances, etc. \n\n4. AZ Resident Friendly. The admission price was $12 and I cringed a little, but then as if I was meant to get a little cultured that day, they told me that AZ residents receive free admission every second Sunday of the month. Not a bad way to take care of the residents melting in the heat! \n\n5. Cafe food you actually want to eat. To make the most of the day, I ate at the cafe and took advantage of the 85 degree weather while it still lasted. The food...was good. I had a warm turkey and brie sandwich on homemade cranberry bread with the corn pasta salad.

I have been to the theater to see the Nutcracker when I was a kid and I saw the Lion King in New York when I was a kid as well. I remember them being fun, but that's about the extent of my memories of the theater. There happened to be a groupon for the play \"The Mystery of Irma Vep\" that my mom purchased for the four of us (mom, myself, husband, sister) to attend. \n\nWe got there a bit early after dinner and walked around the theater looking at the art that was up around the building. There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasn't dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans. \n\nHowever the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black \"Friday\" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didn't get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didn't get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it. \n\nAfter coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon.

Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. \n\nThe atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.\n\nThe Food and Drinks:\nWell to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.\n\nAppetizers:\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.\n\nDragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.\n\nSatay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!\n\nWild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.\n\nVeggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.\n\nHot Pot:\nWe also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.\n\nMain Course:\nI had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!\n\nOnce again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.\n\nDesert:\nOMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!\n\nWill I go back?\nI wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.\n\nHats off to The Wild Thaiger.\nThe best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-05", "type": "review"}

Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.\n\nI got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \"warm\", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \"yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \"you know, that was REALLY good!\"\n\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.

Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \n\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\n\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \n\nQuick review:\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\n\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\n\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\n\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \n\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\n\nAll in all, outstanding.

Fresh flavors, enough spice to taste (you can pick your level on most items), great flavor combos without going overboard - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors. \n\nLast night I had the privilege of meeting the owner, Olashawn. She's an awesome woman with a passion for what she does, and one of the most down-to-earth people I've ever met. If you go in, make sure to give her a wave, you'll see her behind the counter and behind the line, cooking and working just as hard if not harder then everyone else.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-05", "type": "review"}

Very impressed with their assorted curry dishes. Highly recommend. Don't expect fancy atmosphere. The staff moves at their own pace but that doesn't matter when the food is soooo good.", "business_id": "jqo3Ljexof9sA8PhSTwEjA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-16", "type": "review"}

Great margaritas and nice outdoor dinning area.  The enchilidas were good, although I think I prefer the preparation at an authentic Mexican restaurant.\n\nThe fried wonton \"tortilla\" chips and salsa were an excellent starter.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-05-08", "type": "review"}
